"Dow tumbles more than 200 points in wild session, S&P 500 closes in correction territory","Seems we're heading toward a market correction, expert says 3:58 PM ET Mon, 29 Oct 2018 | 02:36

Stocks closed lower on Monday, giving up sharp gains from earlier in the day in a wild session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average travel more than 900 points. The S&P 500 closed in correction territory, down 10 percent from its recent high.

Traders blamed the possibility of more U.S.-China tariffs coupled with a drop in tech shares for the decline.

The Dow fell 245.39 points to 24,442.92, erasing a 352-point gain, as Boeing dropped 6.6 percent. At the lows of the day, the Dow was down 566 points before coming back shortly before the close. The 30-stock index also briefly dipped into correction territory.

The S&P 500 closed 0.7 percent lower at 2,641.25 after gaining more than 1 percent earlier in the day. The benchmark is now down 10.2 percent from its high reached at the end of September. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 percent to 7,050.29 as shares of Amazon got pounded.

""I think this is an old-fashion tech wreck,"" said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. ""Investors are reassessing growth prospects for next year.""

Bloomberg News reported that the U.S. is planning on slapping tariffs on more Chinese products if upcoming talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping falter. Both countries have already implemented levies on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods.

Amazon and Netflix rolled over throughout the day, capping the stock market's gains; the stocks were down 6.3 percent and 5 percent, respectively. These losses offset strong gains from bank shares. J.P Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo both climbed more than 1 percent, while Goldman Sachs gained 1 percent. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) surged 1.8 percent."

Some corporate officials have cautioned that between higher borrowing costs and an uncertain tariff outlook, 2019 could prove a tough year for stocks. Wilson pointed out that about half of all the stocks in the broad MSCI U.S. Equity Index are at least 20 percent below their 52-week highs.

""The markets seem to agree and have been quietly revolting all year,"" Wilson added. ""We don't think the revolts will stop until central banks pause or at least signal they are concerned. With the Fed having to respond to still strong economic data and the desire to remain apolitical, we think it could take another 200 S&P points making 2450 a reasonable downside target to consider.""

The S&P 500 is off more than 8.5 percent from its all-time high in September, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off by more than 7.6 percent. Some, such as Goldman Sachs' equity chief, see the stock market sell-off over the past month as ""overdone"" and a buying opportunity.

""The recent sell-off has priced too sharp of a near-term growth slowdown,"" David Kostin, Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist, said in a note to clients. ""We expect continued economic and earnings growth will support a rebound in the S&P 500.""

The rosier view from Goldman comes amid a largely solid economic backdrop. Third-quarter GDP rose 3.5 percent, according to a preliminary reading Friday.

Still, Morgan Stanley has defended its forecast for a dismal stock performance this year, even as the S&P 500 rallied 9.5 percent by mid-September. Since then, stocks have plunged more than 8 percent, erasing nearly all of their 2018 gains over that span of five weeks as the markets appear to reward Wilson's persistence.

The strategist also said that the U.S. equity market sold off in ways ""we haven't seen in years,"" highlighting losses in technology and consumer discretionary stocks. Wilson said those sectors are where money managers have the most exposure, and translates into ""extreme portfolio pain.""

""The rolling bear market is quickly moving to complete its job with growth stocks (Tech, Health Care and Discretionary) catching up on the downside and we don't think it will be over until this gap is completely closed,"" he wrote.

Wilson's bear case for the market of 2,400 implies more than 10 percent downside from current levels; his base case of 2,750 implies around 3 percent upside.

Dow swings more than 900 points during wild day of trading,"New York (CNN Business) Glee about a big tech merger sent stocks soaring Monday, but then dread about the threat of new tariffs on China sent them plunging. The Dow swung more than 900 points from its highs of the day to its lows and finished with a more than 245-point loss.

Stocks turned lower in the afternoon after Bloomberg reported that the White House is considering more tariffs on Chinese goods by December if the next round of negotiations between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping do not go well.

""We'll see what happens,"" said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Monday about the meeting. ""We're not going to get ahead of those conversations.""

The S&P 500 fell 0.7% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.6%. The Dow, which had been up more than 350 points earlier Monday morning, is now more than 9% below its all time highs. Both the Dow and S&P 500 gave up their gains for the year as well.

The Dow was dragged lower in particular by Boeing ( BA ), which has significant exposure to China and also has the highest stock price in the Dow. Shares fell 6.6%. (The Dow is weighted by stock price, not market value like most other indexes.)"
"Stock Market Selloff is 'Overdone' and Could Rebound on Buybacks, Goldman Says","With the S&P 500 Index down 9.7% since Oct. 3, Goldman Sachs weighed in to assure rattled investors that things may not be as bad as the last month of market turbulence makes it seem.

The October selloff in U.S. stocks has left the market “oversold,” wrote Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin in a note to clients. What’s more, help is on the way in the form of corporate buybacks, he wrote.

“The recent sell-off has priced too sharp of a near-term growth slowdown,” Kostin’s note read. “We expect continued economic and earnings growth will support a rebound in the S&P 500.”

Stocks have tumbled this month on concern about rising interest rates, which not only make borrowing more expensive for companies, but also make bonds more competitive investments to stocks. The benchmark 10-year treasury yield has risen to 3.076% Tuesday from 1.321% in July 2016.

In addition to the S&P 500’s 9.7% decline, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 8.9% and the Nasdaq Composite is down 12.1% since Oct. 3.

Investors are also worried about the impact of a trade war between the U.S. and China, which showed signs of escalating even further Monday on reports that President Trump may impose a new round of tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports if trade talks next month between the U.S. and China don’t ease the trade war.

Kostin acknowledged that there are concerns about the U.S. economy in the next few years, but not enough to warrant such an abrupt decline in stock prices. He forecast the S&P 500 would close the year at 2850, an 8% gain from the index’s close on Monday.

One traditional pillar of support for stocks may have been missing for much of this month. Goldman noted that a “blackout” period during which companies avoid share repurchases in the two weeks before reporting earnings coincided with the selloff. Kostin said that nearly half of S&P 500 companies are out of those blackout phases, which could lead to $170 billion in buybacks in the next month.

Buybacks were expected to rise in 2018 because of the extra money that Trump’s tax cuts left in corporate coffers. But that hasn’t helped lift companies buying back shares. Two ETFs that focus on companies aggressive about buybacks—the SPDR S&P 500 Buyback ETF and the Invesco BuyBack Achievers ETF—have both underperformed the S&P 500 Index this year."
