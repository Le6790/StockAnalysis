Word Is Bond(s)

Stocks were mixed at midday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2% while the S&P 500 was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite had risen 0.4%.

The bond market is open again Tuesday after being closed for Monday’s Columbus Day holiday, after trading near 3.25% overnight, the 10-year Treasury yield has pulled back to 3.21%.

Higher yields have spooked markets lately. Commentary from the Federal Reserve suggested it could raise rates more aggressively in response to inflationary pressures. But without evidence that prices are actually taking off, the move in yields may be more accurately considered “in part a response to evidence of firming growth,” writes Ameriprise ’s David Joy. Yet even if higher yields reflect growth and not inflation, “at some level equity prices are likely to come under increasing pressure, as bonds become relatively more attractive, and air comes out of equity valuations,” he says.

We saw that when the S&P 500 dropped 1% last week, mostly on Thursday and Friday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke, marking only the second time stocks have fallen two weeks in a row since June.

Still, investors appear to be getting more comfortable with higher yields—and there is a case for at least some optimism. Credit Suisse ’s Jonathan Golub writes that rising interest rates are a positive for equities until 10-year Treasury debt reaches 3.5%, but that’s not the end of the story. “Importantly, this threshold doesn’t represent a cliff. Rather, rising yields are a positive, diminishing tailwind up to 3½% and an increasing headwind beyond that point.”

So rising yields aren’t great, but they aren’t a disaster either.

Investors could also be pushing ahead in hopes of another strong earnings season, as third-quarter reports are due to start hitting the wires later this week. Consensus estimates call for S&P 500 third-quarter earnings to rise 19%, while sales climb 7.2%. Still, Morgan Stanley warns that strong results may not be enough: Investors will likely be keenly focused on fourth-quarter outlooks, given the likelihood that comparisons may stiffen and the potential impact of tariffs—a subject management teams haven’t elaborated on much.

Bulls don’t have to look very far to make their case: The U.S. economy is on “solid footing,” U.S. companies are bringing cash home, the consumer is healthy, and tariffs haven’t been a game changer yet, writes SunTrust’s Keith Lerner. “We are in a mature part of the cycle,” with both positive and negative factors at play, he writes, but the evidence “suggests the bull still has legs but we continue to expect a bumpier path.” After all, valuations remain cheap, the near-term risk of a recession is low, and central banks are still broadly accommodative, even as geopolitical risks are climbing as the economic cycle matures.

UBS ’s Michael Crook takes aim at the worry that market breadth has narrowed, i.e. that a few stocks are responsible for the lion’s share of the market’s gains. He notes that so far in 2018, 185 companies, or 37% of the S&P 500, have outperformed the index. “That’s down a bit from recent years and the historical annual average of 44.3%, but paints a very different picture than claiming all of the returns are due to just a few stocks,” he says.

Let’s hope that this party’s guest list doesn’t get too exclusive.

Stocks close mostly lower after volatile session as bond yields remain in focus,"U.S. stocks closed mostly lower Tuesday after a volatile session as investors continued to fret over the implication of higher bond yields on equities. The Nasdaq, however, snapped a three-day losing streak in line with a rebound in technology shares.

How did major benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% fell 56.21 points, or 0.2%, to 26,430.57 and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% slid 4.09 points, or 0.1%, to 2,880.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% bucked the trend to edge up 2.07 points to 7,738.02 as tech stocks outperformed the broader market.

The S&P 500 dipped below its 50-day moving average, a closely watched gauge of short-term momentum, for a third day. However, it rebounded to close above it, suggesting it could also serve as a support level. The benchmark index hasn’t closed below its average since July.

What drove the market?

Recent trading has been driven by rising bond yields and interest rates, both of which could signal a new phase in postcrisis markets that have enjoyed a protracted period of ultralow yields.

Higher yields equate to steeper borrowing costs for corporations and investors alike, and have caused a reassessment of equity valuations, already deemed lofty by some measures. On top of that, richer rates of so-called risk-free bonds can compete against equities, which are perceived as comparatively riskier.

Climbing rates, however, have come against a solid backdrop for the domestic economy, with a number of economic indicators supporting the notion that the U.S. expansion continues apace.

On Tuesday, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.21% fell 2.3 basis points to 3.206%, though it continued to hover near its highest level since 2011.

Traders also continue to watch for the latest developments on trade policy, as well as political uncertainty abroad, especially with respect to Italy’s budget targets.

Opinion: Stock market risks have risen in the past week, according to Elliott Wave

On Monday, the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast for this year and next to 3.7%, which for both years is 0.2% below its prior forecast in July. This reflects weaker growth in advanced economies, rising trade tensions and higher oil prices.

In the latest economic data, the National Federation of Independent Business small-business optimism index fell 0.9 point in September, falling from a 45-year high to a seasonally adjusted level of 108.8.

On the Fed front, Robert Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said that cyclical inflation pressures were building, but that inflation wasn’t likely to spin out of control.

What were analysts saying?

Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch expect interest rates to stabilize around current levels for now but predicted they could rise further in the longer term.

“We continue to believe the curve should flatten as the Fed continues on their tightening path and see real money demand for the long-end offsetting higher supply. On balance, the risks to our forecasts are skewed toward higher rate levels and a flatter curve, though it may take a further improvement in productivity or global growth to shift rates materially upward,” Mark Cabana, a rates strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a report.

Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, said that the S&P 500’s 50-day moving average was serving as a support level.

“We do not expect this zone to be violated. However, even a pullback to 2,817 would not ’dent’ this secular bull market. This week there is a fairly strong negative energy blast due, but it should subside by week’s end,” he wrote in a note.

What stocks were in focus?

Shares of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.26% GOOG, +0.19% Google’s parent company, fell 0.9%. The Wall Street Journal reported that Google exposed the private data of hundreds of thousands of users of the Google+ social network and then opted not to disclose the issue this past spring, in part because of fears that doing so would draw regulatory scrutiny and cause reputational damage. Separately, Bloomberg reported that Google has withdrawn from consideration for a massive Pentagon cloud-computing contract.

American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -1.34% reversed direction to sink 6.6%. The airline had raised its third-quarter outlook for total revenue per available seat mile and said it expects to record $230 million in charges for fleet restructuring and merger integration expenses among other items.

Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +0.09% shares climbed 2.1% after Bill Ackman revealed that his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management LP built a roughly 1.1% stake worth $900 million in the company. Ackman said Starbucks shares have been pressured by a slowdown in same-store sales but given that same-store sales have been consistently positive, Ackman believes there is room for growth.

D.R. Horton Inc. DHI, +0.08% dropped 3.1% after it reported fourth-quarter sales data that was below expectations.

Facebook Inc. FB, +1.40% shares rose 0.4%. The social-media company on Monday announced the launch of Portal, a video-calling device meant to help users “connect with friends and family” with artificial intelligence-powered cameras, but some privacy advocates have questioned the timing of the tablet device’s launch.

Papa John’s International Inc. PZZA, +0.67% soared 8.9% on a Wall Street Journal report that Trian Fund Management LP is evaluating a take over bid.

Perrigo Co. PLC PRGO, +1.44% fell 1.8% after it late Monday named Murray Kessler as president and chief executive.

Affimed NV AFMD, +1.12% sank 24% after the biotech drug developer put two clinical trials on hold following the death of a study participant.

What were other markets doing?

Asian shares saw a mixed performance, with Japanese equities down while European indexes ended mostly higher.

Crude-oil prices CLK9, -0.58% gained, while gold GCM9, -0.07% settled slightly higher and the U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.07% traded mostly flat.

Is it time to rate-proof your investment portfolio?

With a recent spike in borrowing costs causing swings in the market and angst on Wall Street, now might be a good time for investors to consider rejiggering their portfolios and shifting toward investments that fare better when interest rates are rising.

A market-moving shift appears to be underway. The long period of historically low rates in place since the 2008 financial crisis – which enabled homebuyers to get cheap mortgages, car shoppers to obtain 0-percent loans and corporations to grow their businesses and profits with the help of cheap money – is reversing as investors and the Federal Reserve, reacting to an improving U.S. economy, push borrowing costs back toward more normal levels.

The Fed has hiked short-term rates three times this year, raising its key rate – which it slashed to zero in 2008 – to a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. Adding to investors' concern is the recent rise in the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to above 3.25 percent, a seven-year high.

Investors fear that higher rates will slow the economy and dent corporate profits. Those potential obstacles have caused increased market volatility on Wall Street in the past four trading sessions, with the Dow Jones industrial tumbling nearly 400 points. It has also changed the outlook for many types of investments, ranging from stocks to bonds to real estate.

As a result, ""portfolios need to shift"" to respond to the changing risk and reward profile of different investments, Michael Wilson, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research report.

Despite conventional thinking that rising rates are bad for stocks, historical data show that the broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index has actually posted strong returns. Stocks moved higher in 12 of the 15 periods since 1950 when the 10-year Treasury yield was rising, or 80 percent of the time, according to data from SunTrust Advisory Services. In fact, the S&P 500 posted average annualized returns of 12.6 percent during those 15 periods.

""This makes sense as higher rates tend to coincide with an expanding economy,"" says Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services.

Trying to pinpoint how high the yield on the 10-year note must climb before it becomes a major hindrance for the stock market is tough to decipher.

Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub cites 3.5 percent as a threshold to watch, while Lindsey Bell of Wall Street research firm CFRA cites 4 percent and Bank of America Merrill Lynch says it would have to jump to 5 percent before bonds would look more attractive than stocks.

But not every investment fares well when borrowing costs are going up. Here's a basic game plan, based on past history, on what to own and what to avoid when interest rates are rising:

Stocks to buy ... and avoid

The best companies whose stocks you should own when borrowing costs are rising are those without a lot of debt and plenty of cash on hand, says Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets.

His firm cited a list of stocks that fit this profile, including A.O. Smith, which makes water heaters; video game maker Electronic Arts; health insurer Humana; and semiconductor giant Intel.

Some segments of the stock market fare better than others when the 10-year U.S. government bond is moving higher. The top performers going back to 1970 are tech stocks, energy shares, companies that sell discretionary goods to consumers and big industrial companies, according to data from CFRA Research.

What sectors to favor depends, in part, on why borrowing costs are becoming more expensive, says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network.

""When rates are rising because of faster growth, you want to be overweight sectors that benefit from that growth, like financials or technology,"" McMillan explains. ""When rates are rising because inflation is rising, you want to be exposed to sectors that trade in things that will be affected by inflation – such as energy.""

Banks are also viewed as a good place to park cash when rates are rising, according to Belski.

Financial institutions that lend money benefit when the economy is strong and people have jobs and income to pay back their loans. Banks also benefit from rising rates as the spread widens between the rate they earn on loans versus the interest they pay to depositors.

The parts of the market that normally feel the most pain when rates are rising are those that investors seek out for income and which pay out sizable dividends, such as utilities, real estate and telecom, says McMillan.

These interest rate-sensitive stocks are known as ""bond proxies."" Real estate companies in the S&P 500 now yield 3.58 percent, while utilities are yielding close to 3.5 percent, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices show. The interest payout on the 10-year Treasury is approaching those levels.

""(These stocks) tend to become less attractive relative to bonds – the other income investment – as rates rise, so should be avoided,"" McMillan advises.

Homebuilders and auto companies can also come under pressure, as sales of homes and cars, trucks and SUVs could stall due to higher financing costs. ""Affordability becomes worse as rates go higher,"" says Lerner.

Bond strategies to consider

The bad news for current bond holders is that when yields rise, the price of the underlying bond falls. But the good news is that rising income payments from the higher-yielding bonds over time will more than offset the loss of principal and leave investors with a positive total return, a BlackRock analysis of the last rising rates cycle from 2003 to 2006 found.

Buying bonds with shorter maturities can also reduce the potential for losses when rates rise, adds SunTrust's Lerner. The reason: the more quickly your bond matures – and the issuer pays your principal back – the faster you can reinvest the money into a new, higher-yielding bond.

""If you buy a 10-year bond at 2 percent and the yield quickly jumps to 3 percent, 10 years is a long time to earn a lower yield,"" Lerner explains. In contrast, a 2-year Treasury bond now yields close to 2.9 percent, which not only delivers a comparable return but can be reinvested in 24 months at a better rate if rates continue to rise.

Investors putting money in the bond market will benefit from the higher yields. The current 3.25 percent yield on the 10-year Treasury, for example, offers a far better risk-free return than it did back in October 2016, when the yield was closer to 1.75 percent.

Real estate pain

Rising interest rates mean more expensive mortgages, which crimps affordability for prospective homebuyers. And if fewer people can afford homes, that also could cause real estate prices to stagnate or even fall, crimping the build up in equity of current homeowners, analysts say.

""Real estate is one sector that tends to perform (worse) when rates begin to rise,"" says CFRA's Bell.

Why the S&P 500's Q3 rally isn't everything it's cracked up to be: A Foolish Take,"CLOSE Millennials are driving a change in how the super rich invest their money, with a shift towards more conscious investments. Elizabeth Keatinge has more. Buzz60

A strong quarter still pales in comparison to what investors saw earlier in the bull market.

As part of the run-up of the major U.S. stock indices, the value of the S&P 500 has reached a record 2,874. If stocks continue to rally, it should reach the magic 3,000 market by year's end. (Photo: Thinkstock)

The third quarter of 2018 just ended, and the stock market enjoyed extremely good returns during the period. The S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) had its best performance in nearly five years, climbing more than 7 percent and setting record highs in the process. Several other benchmarks – including the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the Nasdaq Composite – have also given investors impressive gains.

Yet as impressive as a 7 percent return in a single quarter might seem, it just barely cracks the top 10 when you look at how the stock market has done over the past 10 years. Below are the best quarters from the period, including those that beat out 2018's third quarter.

The reason why the S&P 500's third-quarter performance looks so good in comparison to recent history is that the stock market has been extremely well-behaved over the past several years. For a good chunk of that period, there was very little market volatility, with steady gains interrupted only very occasionally by small downturns that quickly gave way to the prevailing long-term uptrend.

By contrast, coming out of the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009, markets were on edge, and benchmarks saw a lot more volatility. The market didn't always make big moves, but in 10 out of 14 quarters from late 2008 to early 2012, the market finished the quarter either up or down by 10 percent or more.

Investors need to be prepared for the possibility that more historically normal levels of volatility will return to the market. That doesn't automatically mean that markets will fall, but it does mean that investors need to be on their toes and be ready to adjust to changing conditions quickly. Until then, it's important to keep even solid quarters like the one that just ended in the proper perspective.
