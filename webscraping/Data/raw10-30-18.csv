Dow Jones finishes day up more than 400 points as stocks show signs of recovery after awful month,"Stocks closed solidly higher on Wall Street as the market clawed back a small part of the ground it lost in October, with the Dow Jones finishing up more than 400 points.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 431 points, or 1.8 percent, to 24,874.

Even with the comeback, though, the Dow is down 5.9 percent this month, and is still sitting at its worst performance since August 2015, according to CNBC.

The Nasdaq added 111 points, or 1.6 percent, to 7,161, and the S&P 500 index rose 41 points, or 1.6 percent to 2,682, thought it's still down 7.9 percent this month.

Those numbers mean the S&P is on pace to record its worst month since May of 2010.

Bond prices fell, as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.12 percent.

Several companies gained ground Tuesday after reporting results that pleased investors.

Oreo maker Mondelez International climbed five percent Tuesday, and athletic clothing maker Under Armour soared 27.8 percent.

American Tower jumped 5.3 percent.

General Electric plunged 8.8 percent after slashing its dividend and disclosing a criminal probe into its accounting.

GE all but eliminated its quarterly dividend, cutting it to a penny from 12 cents a share to conserve about $4 billion in cash and strengthen the balance sheet.

Despite GE's plunge to its lowest level since early 2009, the finishing numbers were the result of solid growth throughout the day for several companies.

Stocks generally opened the day mostly higher, following that trend through the closing bell.

But internet giants including Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc have suffered a battering over the last month.

Facebook Inc on Tuesday beat analysts' profit estimates but missed targets for growing monthly users and reported its slowest revenue growth in about six years.

The social network is keeping costs in check better than some investors anticipated but is facing challenges growing users, causing shares to swing in both directions after the third-quarter results.

Shares of Facebook were up about 3 percent to $146.22 after initially falling as much as 5 percent following the bell, when they had closed up 2.9 percent at $146.22."
Dow rallies more than 400 points in bounce as brutal October nears a close,"U.S. stocks snapped higher Tuesday as markets eased some of the month's brutal losses before the end of October.

The S&P 500 rallied more than 1.5 percent to close at 2,682.63 as communications, energy and materials stocks carried the index out of correction territory. Shares of Charter Communications, DISH Network and Twitter all rose more than 4 percent each.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by 431.72 points to finish at 24,874.64. Goldman Sachs, McDonald's and Boeing all outperformed the broader blue-chip index.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose more than 1.5 percent to close at 7,161.65. That index climbed thanks to a 5.2-percent rally in Intel and a 4.7-percent gain in CNBC-parent Comcast; e-commerce giant Amazon shed 0.5 percent during the session.

The rebound on Tuesday followed a shaky start to the week in the prior session that saw stocks giving up sharp gains. The Dow traveled more than 900 points on Monday. Market participants cited the possibility of more U.S.-China tariffs, a drop in tech stocks and worries over higher interest rates for the decline.

After Tuesday's comeback, the Dow is down 5.9 percent this month, still its worst performance since August 2015. The S&P 500 is off by 7.9 percent in October, on track for its worst month since May 2010. On Monday, the S&P 500 closed in correction territory, down 10.2 percent from its record.

""Obviously we're in a correction phase of the stock market and I think investors have to realize that,"" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. ""The monetary environment has changed. As you can see, even with a 10 percent change in the stock markets, interest rates have barely moved lower.""

""Typically bull markets are global in scope and the question was: would we follow the rest of the world, or would they follow us? I think we've found the answer,"" Bittles added.

Even with the most recent sell-off, U.S. stocks have generally outperformed overseas indexes throughout 2018. The Stoxx Europe 600, which was little changed Tuesday, is down more than 8 percent for the year. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite has fallen more than 24 percent since January. The Chinese index rose 1 percent Tuesday."
Dow soars 432 points. The bull market's not over yet,"New York (CNN Business) October's market turmoil took an off-day Tuesday.

The Dow soared more than 432 points, while the Nasdaq and the broader S&P 500 rose 1.6%. Investors were relieved to hear President Donald Trump comment Tuesday that he is willing to negotiate with China on a trade pact.

Markets tumbled Monday on fears that the Trump administration could impose a new round of Tariffs on China.

Some experts warn that the bull market is peaking. Big tech stocks are plunging as earnings growth has slowed, interest rates have risen and the threat of a longer China trade war has intensified. The S&P 500 fell 8% lower this month.

But Brian Belski, chief investment strategist for BMO Capital Markets, thinks there are many years left before things turn around.

Stocks rally to close higher after Monday’s big reversal,"Stocks closed higher Tuesday as President Donald Trump signaled that the U.S. is ready to reach a deal to ease trade tensions with China, giving the market some much-needed relief.

However, trading was volatile with the indexes choppy a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average staged an ugly reversal to end the session with a triple-digit loss, partly on the back of tariff worries amid fears about global growth and peak earnings.

How did major benchmarks fare?

The Dow DJIA, +0.79% rose 431.72 points, or 1.8%, to 24,874.64; the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.82% gained 41.38 points, or 1.6%, to 2,682.63; and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% climbed 111.36 points, or 1.6%, to 7,161.65.

On Monday, all main indexes finished sharply lower, with the Dow swinging more than 900 points. The reversal added to the market’s October woes, with the blue-chip index down about 6% month-to-date, while the S&P 500 is off 8% and the Nasdaq has fallen 11%.

What drove the market?

Stocks have entered a decidedly more volatile phase of trade, fueled by myriad concerns, with doubts about the health of the global economy chief among them.

Moreover, shares of companies that have done the most to help drive the U.S. stock market to repeated highs have come off the rails. So-called FAANGs, the acronym referring to technology and internet-related giants Facebook Inc. FB, +1.39% , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.99% , Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.54% , Netflix Inc. NFLX, -0.91% and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.38% GOOG, +0.56% were all trading sharply lower for the month. Amazon on Monday fell into bear-market territory, wiping out about $120 billion in market value in two trading sessions.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is in correction territory, defined as a drop of at least 10% from a recent peak, while the Dow and S&P 500 were at one point flirting with tumbling into correction for the second time in 2018.

Comments from Trump during a Fox News interview late Monday about his readiness for a deal with China helped to boost sentiment even though the president did not indicate that an agreement was imminent. During the interview with Laura Ingraham of Fox News, he said that the U.S. “will make a great deal with China and it has to be great, because they’ve drained our country.”

Stock losses on Monday had accelerated after a Bloomberg News report indicated the White House is prepared to announce tariffs on remaining Chinese imports if talks next month between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping don’t yield results.

Markets were also digesting a raft of quarterly corporate results with several big-name companies set to report earnings this week.

What data were in focus?

Home-price gains are slowing, as the Case-Shiller 10-city composite index showed a 0.6% increase from last month’s reading, or a 5.5% annual increase. The 20-city composite index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1% and was 5.5% higher compared to its level a year ago, the lowest annual increase in nearly two years.

Consumer sentiment hit an 18-year high, according to the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index, which rose to 137.9, from 135.3 in September.

The residential vacancy rate fell 0.4 percentage points from a year earlier to 7.1%, according to the Census Bureau report, which also showed that the U.S. homeownership rate was virtually unchanged at 64.4%

What were analysts saying?

“We are seeing an oversold technical rally before we head even lower,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, predicted. “Most traders I talk to are still waiting for the capitulation to shake off before they call a bottom.”

“Once again, the month of October has been living up to its frightful reputation for wreaking havoc on stock prices: 1929 and 1987 are prime examples, and we can now safely say that 2018 will also go down in history as an illustration of October’s ability to scare investors. Unfortunately, I don’t foresee this volatility easing too much over the next few weeks,” Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, said in a note to clients.

What stocks were in focus?

General Electric Co. GE, -5.54% sank 8.8% after it slashed its dividend and reported disappointing third-quarter results but announced a restructuring of its power business.

Shares of Coca-Cola Co. KO, +2.90% rose 2.5% after the beverage and snack giant reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations.

Pfizer Inc.’s stock PFE, +1.58% fell 0.8% after the pharmaceutical giant reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations but revenue that missed, and provided a downbeat revenue outlook.

Shares of cloud services firm Akamai Technologies, Inc. AKAM, +0.94% surged 17% after the firm beat third-quarter estimates and raised its fourth-quarter guidance and full-year outlook in an earnings release Monday evening.

Under Armour Inc. UAA, +3.20% jumped 25% after the company announced third-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ estimates.

Shares in Cognizant Technology Corp. CTSH, +1.32% slid 3.9% after the technology-services firm said its profit shrank in the third quarter, year-over-year, falling short of analysts expectations.

Masco Corp. MAS, +1.31% rallied 7.5% after missing analysts profit estimates, but surpassing revenue expectations.

KLA-Tencor Corp. KLAC, +1.93% jumped 7.6% following a third-quarter earnings release that beat Wall Street estimates.

Chesapeake Energy Corp. CHK, -3.63% skidded 12% after it announced that it would acquire WildHorse Resource Development Corp. WRD, -3.55% in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $4 billion. WildHorse shares were up 6.4%.

How were other markets trading?

Asian markets finished higher but European stocks were mostly lower as the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, -0.17% slipped.

Oil futures US:CLZ8 extended losses and gold prices GCZ8, -0.16% settled lower, while the U.S. dollar DXY, +0.42% was firmer.

Trump puts himself in pause-that-refreshes camp as stock markets limp through bruising October’s final days,"‘The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause — people want to see what happens with the Midterms.’ Donald Trump

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said a downturn in U.S. equity markets that has wiped out year-to-date gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 is just a “pause,” after a powerful rally since his shock victory over Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8, 2016. He offered his remarks in an early Tuesday tweet:

The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2018

Since the day after the 2016 presidential election, the S&P 500 has gained more than 23%, the Dow is up about 33%, and the Nasdaq has advanced nearly 36%, nearly two years ago.

However, October has been brutal for Wall Street investors. The Dow DJIA, +0.79% is down 7.6% so far this month, which points it toward its largest one-month decline since May 2010. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.82% is down 9.4% this month, which would be its deepest monthly loss since February 2009, while the Nasdaq Composite Index is off 12.4%, which would be its largest one-month drop since October 2008.

Trump also warned that voting Democratic in the midterm elections next Tuesday, Nov. 6, would render the recent declines more than a blip:

‘If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!’ Donald Trump

Critics on Twitter and elsewhere pointed out that the stock market has been on an upward trajectory since the early stages of Barack Obama’s first term and argued that forecasting stock-market declines under Democrats was no less a scare tactic than the recent Republican focus on a caravan of prospective asylum seekers wending its way toward the U.S.’s southern border.

One Twitter account tossed up data on stock gains under Democratic and Republican presidents over the past century:

1929 to 2016 #StockMarket returns under #Democratic Presidents 57.4% under #Republican Presidents 16.65% LOL Dream on Donald! More #MAGA lies — Jodi (@1Angry_lioness) October 30, 2018

The data referenced in that tweet appeared likely to have stemmed from a report cited in a Forbes piece published in 2016.

GE slashes dividend to a penny to fix debt-riddled balance sheet,"New York (CNN Business) General Electric is under such financial stress that new CEO Larry Culp is slashing the troubled conglomerate's 119-year-old dividend to just a penny a share.

GE revealed on Tuesday worse-than-expected results and a $22 billion accounting writedown for its beleaguered power division. Culp plans to split up the power division to accelerate a turnaround.

The company also announced that the SEC and Justice Department are investigating the charge, which reflects the deterioration of businesses GE has acquired. The news adds to GE's mounting legal problems and helped send the stock plunging 9% to a nine-year low. It was GE's worst day since March 2009.

In a bid to fix GE's debt-riddled balance sheet, Culp announced the company will cut its quarterly dividend from 12 cents a share starting in 2019. By paying just a token dividend, GE ( GE ) will save about $3.9 billion of cash per year.

Analysts had been anticipating a potential dividend cut , though not one of this magnitude.

It's an especially painful move for a company that long viewed its stable dividend as a source of pride. But years of bad decisions forced GE to halve its dividend last November for just the second time since the Great Depression. The dividend cuts deal a blow to the many GE retirees and mom-and-pop shareholders who long relied on the cherished payouts.

""We are on the right path to create a more focused portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet,"" Culp said in a statement.

Culp, who was suddenly named CEO on October 1 , acknowledged during a conference call ""this is not a quarter that we're particularly proud of.""

Investors may have been spooked by the fact that GE did not even offer guidance for the fourth quarter or 2019.

""There was no reset. They didn't even tell you what the earnings and cash flow will look like. They just don't know,"" said John Inch, an analyst at Gordon Haskett.

GE's cash troubles

Dividend cuts are very rare these days, because the US economy is booming. Most companies, flush with cash from tax cuts, are ramping up their dividends. At least 291 S&P 500 companies have hiked their dividend so far this year, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. Just two S&P 500 companies had cut their dividend as of early October, Silverblatt said.

""We find the move brave and necessary and a sign that Mr. Culp will not take half measures to improve the company,"" CFRA analyst Jim Corridore wrote to clients.

But GE tried to hush calls for the company to strengthen its balance sheet by selling stock. Some analysts have said GE Capital needs a cash infusion totaling billions of dollars.

""Let me state in a straightforward fashion, we have no plans for an equity raise,"" Culp told analysts.

Power problems deepen

GE's power division remains the biggest source of trouble at the company, drowning out strength from its aviation business. Revenue tumbled 33% last quarter at GE Power due to ""continued market and execution challenges."" The division swung to a loss of $631 million, compared with a profit of $464 million the year before.

Jamie Miller, GE's chief financial officer, warned that the problems in power will ""persist longer and with deeper impact"" than previously expected. In light of that, GE expects to significantly miss its full-year earnings and cash flow targets.

""Power is bad and certainly nowhere near as salvageable as Bulls think,"" JPMorgan analyst C. Stephen Tusa, Jr. wrote to clients.

GE Power, which makes turbines for power plants, has been caught badly off guard by the shift away from coal and gas in favor of renewable energy. Under former CEO Jeff Immelt, GE doubled down on fossil fuels by spending $9.5 billion in 2015 to acquire Alstom's power business. The deal turned out to be a disaster, underscored by the $22 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded last quarter.

GE said on Tuesday it will reorganize the power business by creating two units, one focused on natural gas and the other holding the steam, nuclear and other assets. And Culp, who was known for running a tight ship at Danaher , plans to ""consolidate"" GE Power's headquarters structure.

Culp signaled that he's on board with the plan announced by former CEO John Flannery to further dismantle GE by spinning off the health care business and unloading its majority stake in oil and gas giant Baker Hughes ( BHGE ). Culp said GE expects to sell the Baker Hughes stake ""in an orderly fashion, over several years."" And despite his background in health care, Culp said it's probably best for health care to be independent.

Culp also downplayed talk that he could further shuffle GE's executive ranks. ""I feel good about the group that we have here and we're committed to building a stronger General Electric,"" he said."
Dow rises more than 250 points as stock market trades at session highs in early morning action,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average pivoted higher in early morning trade Monday, as the stock market looked set to see whipsaw action that has characterized moves in October. The Dow DJIA, +0.79% most recently, was up 251 points, or 1%, at 24,690, powered by advances in shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -2.13% and McDonald's Corp. MCD, +0.22% pushing higher after a tepid start to trade. On Monday, the Dow saw a 900-point swing that sent it from a big gain to a triple-digit loss, with investors increasingly worried about global economic growth and the earnings outlook for U.S. corporations. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.82% was climbing 1% at 2,667. All 11 of the the broad-market benchmark's sectors were in the green, led by sharp returns in real estate, communications services and consumer staples. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% was also advancing by 1% at 7,119.

NEW YORK – U.S. stocks climbed Tuesday after solid earnings reports from several big companies. Stocks had closed at five-month lows the day before, and groups of companies that struggled badly made big gains.

Many of the best-performing stocks Tuesday came from parts of the market that have fared the worst during the market’s plunge this month. Those included smaller and more U.S.-focused companies, internet and media companies, basic materials makers and energy companies.

Oreo maker Mondelez and athletic apparel maker Under Armour both jumped following strong third-quarter reports.

Corporate earnings are up about 20 percent this year as the U.S. economy gains strength and corporate taxes come down after last year’s tax cut. Analysts expect company profits to keep growing in 2019, but at a slower pace.

Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivative strategist for BTIG, said investors are worried about two things that could slow the economy further: the U.S.-China trade dispute, and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates.

“All of this fear about growth is being traded on something we don’t see in the statistics right now,” he said. “You factually don’t have signs of an economic slowdown yet.”

The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 41.38 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,682.63. On Monday the benchmark index closed at its lowest level since early May following a report that the Trump administration could announce more tariffs on imports from China in December.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 431.72 points, or 1.8 percent, to 24,874.64. The Nasdaq composite advanced 111.36 points, or 1.6 percent, to 7,161.65. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 29.33 points, or 2 percent, to 1,506.64.

Trading remained uneven: the S&P 500 fell at the start of trading and then turned sharply higher. In the afternoon the index gave up all of its gains and briefly turned lower, but recovered to finish near its highest levels of the day.

Mondelez, which makes Cadbury chocolates and Trident gum in addition to Oreos, rose by the most in a year after its quarterly profit surpassed analysts’ projections. Its stock gained 5 percent to $42.12. Other household goods makers also did well. Walmart rose 2.6 percent to $102.42.

Among media companies, video game maker Take-Two Interactive soared 11 percent to $124.01 after it said its game “Red Dead Redemption 2” brought in $725 million in retail sales over its first three days. Take-Two shares are sharply lower this month as media, internet and technology companies have taken a beating.

Some of the worst losses during the market’s current downturn were sustained by longtime investor favorites that had soared in recent months. Amazon and Netflix have both plunged 24 percent in October, but those companies had more to lose than many others did: Amazon is still up 31 percent this year, and Netflix has climbed 49 percent.

Elsewhere among internet and media companies, Comcast jumped 4.8 percent and Facebook rose 2.9 percent to $146.22. The social media company rose another 1.4 percent in aftermarket trading after its third-quarter profit was larger than analysts expected.

Among technology companies, chipmaker Intel rose 5.2 percent to $47.76.

While those stocks have slumped lately, the S&P 500’s index of utilities and household goods makers have each climbed 3 percent this month. The broader S&P 500 has tumbled 7.9 percent over the same time.

General Electric cut its dividend again. The company halved its dividend to 12 cents from 24 cents in December, and cut it to 1 cent Tuesday. The struggling industrial giant also said the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into a $22 billion charge it booked to its power business this year. Securities regulators were also conducting a civil probe.

The stock sank 8.8 percent to $10.18, its lowest price since April 2009.

European stocks mostly fell following a report that the region’s economy slowed down in the third quarter. The economy of the 19-country eurozone unexpectedly slowed in the third quarter. It expanded by 0.2 percent in the July-September period, which fell short of analyst forecasts. Experts say growth is likely to pick up again, but it’s unlikely to match last year’s strong performance as the region faces issues like Britain’s departure from the EU, trade disputes and a clash with Italy over that country’s budget.

Germany’s DAX fell 0.4 percent and France’s CAC 40 lost 0.2 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.1 percent.

A weakening of the Chinese yuan helped some stock indexes in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.5 percent after official data showed that the unemployment rate dipped to 2.3 percent in September. South Korea’s Kospi picked up 0.9 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.9 percent.

Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.12 percent from 3.08 percent.

Benchmark U.S. crude shed 1.3 percent to $66.18 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 1.8 percent to $75.91 per barrel in London.

Wholesale gasoline fell 1 percent to $1.81 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1.1 percent to $2.26 a gallon and natural gas declined 0.3 percent to $3.19 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Gold lost 0.2 percent to $1,225.30 an ounce. Silver rose 0.1 percent to $14.46 an ounce. Copper slumped 2.8 percent to $2.66 a pound.

The dollar rose to 112.96 yen from 112.35 yen. The euro fell to $1.1342 from $1.1390.
