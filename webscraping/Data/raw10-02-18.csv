The 5 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy Now,"Despite all the pundit noise and hate, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still a wonderful place to find great stocks and big-time dividends. The thirty Dow Jones Stocks are still powerhouses in their respective fields and feature enviable moats, large cash flows and big-time profits. With Dow Jones Stocks, you really are getting the top dogs of America’s economic landscape.

There’s a reason why nearly $24 billion still sits in the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA: DIA ), and that’s because the index remains a pretty good collection of blue-chip stocks.

But not all the thirty Dow Jones stocks are big buys at the current moment. Some — be glad you didn’t buy General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) when it was still in the Dow 30 — are actually lousy to purchase in today’s market.

With that in mind, here are five of the best Dow Jones Stocks to buy right now.

Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)

What a difference a few years makes. For heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT ), it’s the difference between being cast aside as a relic and torching record highs.

A few years ago, CAT suffered as slowing growth in China and the rest of the world decreased demand for bulldozers, backhoes, and other construction/farm equipment. Shares of the Dow Jones stock were basically left for dead. Well, guess what? Global growth is surging now.

Across the planet, economic growth has finally returned, boosting spending on major construction projects. Higher commodity prices have helped boost mining equipment demand at the same time. As the leading purveyor of these supplies, Caterpillar’s fortunes have returned and its share price has nearly tripley. With the firm reporting earnings at the end of the month, we’ll see the fruits of that return.

In the end, the return to global growth will be a boon for Caterpillar and its bottom line. That makes CAT one of the Best Dow Jones stocks to own now.

Nike Inc. (NKE)

When you own the dominant and most iconic brands in your operating market, you must be doing something right. That swoosh has made Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE ) investors plenty of coin over the years. And the good times could keep rolling in 2018. The reason is two-fold.

First, Nike has gone gangbusters on its Consumer Direct Offense Initiative. Fellow InvestorPlace contributor Luke Lango highlights the move as an aggressive push to become more fashion forward. That should help it drive sales beyond its core athletic gear market and take away market share from rivals like Adidas AG (ADR) (OTCMKTS: ADDYY ).

Second, Nike has taken its product directly to the consumer. Nike has pushed hard into e-commerce and direct selling to get an edge and boost revenues per purchase.

NKE shares could surge in 2018 as better global and direct sales data overshadows recent hiccups in the domestic markets.

Wal-Mart (WMT)

Retail isn’t dead. Sector kingpin Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT ) has just had its best year since the dot-com days. More could be in store for the Dow Jones stock. That’s because Walmart continues to dominate in online sales.

Walmart has gone all-in for e-commerce to keep up with the increase in online shopping. This push has included buying Jet.com and a whole host of smaller shopping sites, adding additional online shipping/pickup options and beefing up the number of SKUs on Walmart.com. And these efforts seem to be working. Online sales metrics have really begun to add up at Wally World.

And the innovation continues.

Walmart just announced that it is unveiling a new scan and go app that will allow customers to avoid the lines by bleeping their own barcodes while shopping and paying for items before they leave. Aside from sticking it Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), the move will allow WMT to reduce its biggest cost — labor.

That means more money for dividends for WMT shareholders ahead.

McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)

Compared to 2017, the Golden Arches have dulled somewhat. In 2017, McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD ) was one of the best performing Dow Jones stocks, finding a lift from its all-day breakfast, menu simplification and sped-up drive-thru lines. But with MCD stock in the red by 3% this year, there’s some analysts that see MCD stock rallying by double digits over the next 12 month. That said, it’s likely that the real win for MCD could still come. McDonald’s is going back to its roots as a cheap source of calories and bringing back the dollar menu.

With higher-end burger joints like Shake Shack (NASDAQ: SHAK ) and Five Guys killing it, MCD’s is refocusing on its core consumer once again. And that’s people who want to spend a buck on a burger. The fast-food restaurant chain has announced plans to bring back its dollar menu and launch other value-priced offerings. While margins here can be thin, the name of the game is revenues.

And with McDonald’s looking at adding more kiosk and mobile ordering to its stores, like previous pick Walmart, the company could reduce one of the biggest costs for its franchises.

With bargain and value deals once again hitting McDonald’s menu, MCD stock could continue its surge in 2018.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)

2018 has been a good year for pharmaceutical giant Pfizer’s (NYSE: PFE ). PFE stock is up 21%. The reason? The tax plan. Pfizer has been struggling with their high tax rate. In fact, the pharma attempted to buy AstraZeneca plc (ADR) (NYSE: AZN ) and Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN ) in order to be able to “move” to Europe and lower their corporate tax rate.

Pfizer currently has one of the largest U.S. corporate cash piles offshore — roughly $160 billion. After the Republican tax plan takes effect, Pfizer will be able to bring that money into the U.S. — and spend it — at a much lower tax rate.

That’s huge news for investors.

As Pfizer sees a huge influx of capital, the dividends, buybacks and M&A activity is set to explode at the firm.

And the company is not waiting. Pfizer has already boosted its dividend by 6% to 34 cents per share and announced an additional $10 billion in buybacks. That’s on top of its current $6.4 billion buyback program currently underway.

All of this means just one thing: PFE stock will continue to rocket in 2018 as these programs take hold. As a result, Pfizer could be one of the best Dow Jones stocks to hold in the new year.

5 Top Trades for Wednesday: Stitch Fix Plunges as Dow Makes New Highs,"Small caps remained under pressure on Tuesday, falling about 1%, while large cap stocks continued to grind higher. That’s apparent as the Dow Jones hit a new high on Tuesday. Conveniently, the index is the first name on our top trades list.

Top Trades for Tomorrow #1: Dow ETF

Yesterday, we highlighted the collapse in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA: IWM ). It could setup as a perfect buy should it decline just a little bit further. However, it’s the complete opposite situation for the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA: DIA ), which hit a new all-time high Tuesday.

Hopefully no one is long Russell and short the Dow.

The DIA was massively overbought throughout the entire fourth quarter of 2017, shown in the chart with blue oval circling the RSI measurement. It took a long time to work that condition off.

Since July though, the DIA has been in a sharp uptrend (blue line) and I wouldn’t expect that to last forever. Should the DIA take a rest, look for support between $260 and $262. That’s where the 50-day moving average will likely come into play, as well as prior breakout support.

On the upside, look for the 20-day and uptrend support to continue guiding the DIA higher until it no longer does. Keep it simple.

Top Trades for Tomorrow #2: PepsiCo

Shares of PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP ) dipped less than 2% after the company beat on earnings and revenue expectations but altered its full-year guidance.

Above is a five-year weekly chart of PEP, which is breaking below its 75-week moving average. This level has been solid support over the last few years. Below it now, we open up the possibility of a test with the 200-week moving average.

Helping to pressure PEP stock is the series of lower highs the stock registered this summer, emphasized by the blue line on the chart. That could help push Pepsi down to the $102.50-ish area, where it will likely find level support No. 1 and run into the 200-week moving average.

Below that and the 2018 lows near $95 are back in sight.

Top Trades for Tomorrow #3: Stitch Fix

Stitch Fix (NASDAQ: SFIX ) investors can only wish the stock was down about 2% on earnings like PepsiCo. Instead shares are cratering more than 35% after an in-line earnings result and a miss on revenue estimates.

Wall Street clearly isn’t pleased with the results, as SFIX is plunging on the day. Shares gapped below the 50-day and knifed right through the 100-day moving average. I would let this one settle down for a few days before trying to trade it.

Maybe $26 becomes support or perhaps the 200-day stabilizes the name near $27. Either way, wait for those prices to have a better risk/reward setup. Below that, and SFIX could work its way down to prior range support near $19.

Top Trades for Tomorrow #4: BlackBerry

What a reversal we’ve seen. Last Friday, shares of BlackBerry (NYSE: BB ) erupted higher on earnings, tagging $12 and began retreating. However, above downtrend resistance and just over the 200-day moving average, and BB still looked okay.

BB stock must have done too much partying this weekend. On Monday, BlackBerry stock puked and on Tuesday it still looks hungover. Now near $10.50, the question is whether it can stabilize. It has the 20-day and 50-day moving averages just below current levels, as well as the key $10.25 mark.

Aggressive bulls could justify a new long position in BB stock with a stop just below this $10.25 mark on a closing basis.

Top Trades for Tomorrow #5: PayChex

Unlike all the other earnings losers, PayChex (NASDAQ: PAYX ) stock is actually up more than 2% after beating on earnings and revenue expectations.

Despite the wide range on Tuesday, it looks like PAYX will remain in a rising channel (blue lines). Keep it simple. Over $75 and bulls can stay long. Investors can continue to trade it along channel support and resistance as well.

Also recall that InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto called PAYX one of The 8 Best Cash Cow Stocks to Buy for Stable Returns.

BA, +2.72% 3M Co. MMM, +0.11% and Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.41% The climb represented the blue-chip index's 14th all-time high of the year. However, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% ended the session flat at 2,923, but not far from a record of its own as a sharp decline in consumer-discretionary shares XLY, -0.46% pressured the index lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% finished off 0.5% at 7,999. The moves come a day after the revamped North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico helped to underpin a mostly upbeat atmosphere on Wall Street, which outweighed worries about Italy, which has clashed with the European Union after EU officials claimed that the third-largest member of the trade bloc has violated fiscal rules with its recent budget plan. In corporate news, shares of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.25% fell 1.7% as the retailer announced that it was raising minimum wage to $15 an hour, while shares of Stitch Fix Inc.

Intel is leading the Dow while AMD slips,"Shares of Intel Corp. INTC, -2.37% are leading the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% Tuesday morning, up 4.3%, as shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.42% are slumping. Intel has added 12.7 points to the Dow, which is up 9.9 points in morning trading. Intel's share price gain comes a day after analysts took a mixed view on the competitive landscape between Intel and AMD. Intel's stock was cut to underweight at Barclays on Monday, and analyst Blayne Curtis worried that Intel was in a ""costly battle to retain share"" while the market is giving AMD credit for share gains in servers. Also on Monday, Baird's Tristan Gerra downgraded AMD's stock on the expectation that the company would see ""limited"" share gains in the immediate term. Intel shares are up 4.9% so far this year, while the Dow has gained 7.9%.

Retail stocks sink as Amazon raises hourly pay; Dow sets new record high,"Amazon, one of the nation’s largest private employers, said it will raise the minimum wage for its U.S. workers to $15 an hour in November. It also said it will advocate for an increase in the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 an hour since July 2009. Its stock fell, but other retailers suffered bigger losses."
