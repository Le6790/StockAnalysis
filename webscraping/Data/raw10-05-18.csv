Dow falls 325 points-- at lows--as yield jitters buffet stocks for a second session,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined on Friday, with the drop putting the index on the brink of erasing its weekly advance. The Dow DJIA, -0.11% most recently, was down about 191 points, or 0.7%, at 26,436, turning 0.1% lower for the week after starting the day with a 0.5% weekly advance. Rising rates over the past 2 sessions have battered equity benchmarks as investors revalue investments that have benefited from a persistently low interest-rate atmosphere. The pace at rich rates may be attempting to normalize have unsettled some investors. The 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.21% was yielding about 3.23% on Friday, around a seven-year high and sharply higher than the 3.055% where it ended last week. Richer yields mean elevated borrowing costs for corporations and individuals alike (and conversely better returns for savers). The broader market also was under pressure, with the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% off by 1.2%. Technology stocks have been particularly hit by the rate rising environment and disputed reports that China forced some tech companies to install secret chips in their products. Friday's moves also came after a key jobs report showed that the unemployment rate fell in September to the lowest level since 1969, while hiring cooled slightly, with 134,000 jobs created, slightly weaker than the 168,000 expected, while prior months were increased.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 180.43 points, or 0.68 percent, to 26,447.05. The S&P 500 was down 16.04 points, about 0.5 percent, at 2,885.57. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 91.06 points, or 1.16 percent, to 7,788.45.

The Dow's fall to session lows in afternoon trading coincided with the yield on the 10-year Treasury hitting a 7-year high.

U.S. employers added a lower-than-expected number of jobs in September, but the unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent, its lowest since 1969. Economists expected the U.S. economy would add 185,000 jobs in September with the unemployment rate ticking down to 3.8 percent.

Economists noted that the lower number could have been a result of Hurricane Florence, while the Labor Department upwardly revised August’s number.

Another solid jobs report; not too hot and not too cold,” Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, told FOX Business.

Warne is not concerned about the lower-than-expected number of jobs created in September, noting revisions within the past two months, which in total put the number of jobs created in line with expectations.

Commodities were mostly higher.

What Happened in the Stock Market Today -- The Motley Fool,"U.S. stocks declined on Friday, extending yesterday's losses as rising Treasury interest rates overshadowed an encouraging September jobs report. All told, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) fell another 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) dropped a more modest 0.6%.

Today's stock market

Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow (0.68%) (180.43) S&P 500 (0.55%) (16.04)

Tech stocks led the market lower once again, leaving the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLK) down 1.2%. But consumer staples names largely resisted the broader downturn; the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEMKT:XLP) edged just into negative territory at the close.

As for individual stocks, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) endured a particularly volatile session following a leaked internal memo, while disappointing preliminary results sent shares of IPG Photonics (NASDAQ:IPGP) south.

Snap plans for profitability

Shares of Snapchat parent Snap initially rose more than 5% in pre-market trading, but gave back their gains to close down 0.4% after a leaked internal memo revealed the company is targeting sustained profitability for next year.

According to a memo to employees obtained by Cheddar, CEO Evan Spiegel wrote that Snap has not only ""made remarkable progress this year executing toward [its] stretch goal"" of a breakeven fourth quarter, but also set a goal to achieve accelerated revenue growth and profitability for the full-year 2019.

Spiegel further admitted that Snap ""rushed"" the recent redesign of its flagship app, ""solving one problem but creating many others.""

The timing of Spiegel's thoughts is no coincidence; Snap shares plunged more than 5% to an all-time low on Thursday after multiple analysts downgraded the stock. Those downgrades included a note from Evercore's Anthony DiClemente, who argued that Facebook's Instagram is ""irreversibly reducing"" Snap's ability to live up to investors' longer-term expectations.

In the end, it's encouraging to see Spiegel lauding Snap's recent progress and outlining its ambitious long-term goals. But until investors have more concrete results indicating that those targets are achievable, I suspect the stock will remain under pressure.

IPG Photonics' underwhelming update

IPG Photonics stock plunged 13.8% after the high-performance laser manufacturer announced weaker-than-anticipated preliminary third-quarter 2018 results.

IPG now expects quarterly revenue in the range of $355 million to $356 million, down from its previous guidance (provided in July) for $360 million to $390 million. On the bottom line, that should translate into earnings per share of $1.83 to $1.87, also well below IPG's prior outlook for an EPS range of $1.80 to $2.05.

""The global geopolitical and macroeconomic environment remained challenging as we progressed through the third quarter,"" explained IPG Photonics CEO Dr. Valentin Gapontsev. ""These tariff and trade-related headwinds were the primary driver of weaker than expected performance for our business in China and Europe.""

As such, Gapontsev added that IPG's full-year revenue ""may"" arrive below the company's previous guidance for 7% to 9% growth. But investors will need to wait until IPG reports its final third-quarter results in late October for a revised full-year outlook."
Here's Why the Dow Jones Industrial Average Fell on Friday,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen over 280 points today (Oct. 5), increasing a rout that began during Thursday's (Oct. 4) trading session.

With losses continuing to mount, investors are wondering what is causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall on Friday.

In order to keep our readers informed, we've identified two key factors that are pushing all major indexes in the red.

Let's take a look at those factors as well as a strategy you can use to protect your investments if things get worse…

Higher Interest Rates and Job Numbers are Wreaking Havoc on Markets

Today's sell-off is largely the result of this morning's disappointing jobs report and rising bond yields.

First, the U.S. Labor Department released the September jobs report this morning. According to the report, the nation's total nonfarm payroll employment increased 134,000 – well below the 185,000 economists expected.

A drop in national hiring rates is often interpreted as a sign that economic growth is slowing.

When growth slows, public companies are less likely to generate the kind of profits they need to sustain soaring share prices. As a result, investors sell off their shares and the stock loses value.

And that's exactly what we see happening today.

Investors who own stocks listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are closing their positions in case it turns out the stocks can't produce better returns.

Second, the Dow is also falling today thanks to higher interest rates imposed by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Wall Street reacts negatively to higher interest rates because they increase borrowing costs for companies that need to borrow in order to finance their growth.

As a result, higher interest rates can restrict economic growth.

And that's bad for investor returns in much the same way slowing jobs growth is.

Right now, it's too early to tell if today's poor performance is the beginning of a huge market downturn.

But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be preparing for the worst-case scenario…

A closely watched stock-market 'fear gauge' on Wall Street is set for its sharpest weekly surge in over 6 months,"The Cboe Volatility Index extended a steady climb Friday as stocks tumbled, putting the gauge on track for its biggest weekly advance in six months. The so-called VIX VIX, +2.98% is on pace to rise 39%, or 4.7 points, to 16.82. That represents its highest level since March, though it remains below the long-term average between 19 and 20. Wall Street's so-called ""fear index"" uses S&P 500 options to calculate expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. A two-session jump in the VIX coincides with a slump in U.S. stocks over the same period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% has declined 0.2% so far this week, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.22% lost 1.1% thus far and The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% is poised to decline 3.4%, which would represent its worst weekly fall in six months. The losses came as investors reacted to a recent surge in government bond yields, with the 10-year Treasury note TMUBUMUSD10Y yielding 3.24%, compared with 3.055% last week.
