"Dow Jones Industrial Average Closes Down 127 Points, but Did You See the Nasdaq?","Text size

Nasdaq Stands Its Ground. Two of the three major U.S. indexes were unable to sustain early gains and closed in the red, with only the Nasdaq Composite ending in positive territory on Monday. The rally of Chinese stocks didn’t seem to affect how investors view the U.S. market, where many start to worry about the peak earnings and hence slower growth going forward. In today’s After the Bell, we…

S&P 500 Is the Final Holdout. Will It Succumb?

The S&P 500 saw its fourth consecutive day of declines Monday, effectively wiping out most of its recent recovery. The large-cap index dropped 12 points, or 0.4% to close at 2755.9, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 126.93 points, or 0.5%, to reach 25,317.41, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.26% to hit 7468.63.

The indecisiveness of the market leaves many investors wondering what the next move might be, but Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson doesn’t have good news. “We think attempts to rebound were more short lived than sustainable,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday.

Many analysts have noted different sections of the market are feeling the claws of the bear. Growth stocks — the bull market’s darlings — are the latest victims. The last round was particularly painful as large amounts of assets were exposed to those stocks.

Declines have now hit virtually every major asset class, according to Wilson, all of which — except for the S&P 500 — are lagging the consumer price index’s growth year to date. Wilson believes the stalwart S&P 500 will be the next target. “To the chagrin of many, we think the S&P will eventually succumb, too, and probably soon,” Wilson wrote.

One of the worries many investors have is the possible peak of earnings and hence the decline of stock valuation from here onward. The S&P 500 is currently trading at 16 times forward earnings. This level could prove to be a ceiling instead of floor, according to Wilson.

The equity-risk premium — how much excessive return investors require to compensate equity risks — plays a key role in estimating the stock market’s forward valuation, as it reflects how much risk investors see in the market and how optimistic they are about the future.

Calculated as the S&P 500’s 12-month forward earnings yield minus the 10-year Treasury yield, the risk premium hit its lowest level since 2008 on Jan. 26 this year, according to Wilson, indicating investors were in an extreme “risk-on” mode. He thinks that low risk premium was supported by many tailwinds in the economy that time, with the tax cuts just starting to show on the balance sheets, financial conditions still easy with accommodative rates, trade risks still unclear and remote, and inflation cost still manageable.

But things are different now. “As we move later in the cycle and see these tailwinds all turn around, we struggle to see any scenario that will be as supportive of risks assets and sentiment going forward,” he wrote.

If the bond rates declined, there would be concerns about growth, given the Fed’s recent hawkish tilt. But if the rates kept rising, it could also be headwinds at this stage of the cycle, as investors worry about the Fed overshooting with rate hikes and triggering the next recession. Either way, investors’ risk premium is likely to rise and the stock market’s forward valuation will drop as a result.

The Hot Stock

Shares of Jacobs Engineering (JEC) shot to the top of the S&P 500 Monday, on news it will sell a segment.

Jacobs Engineering rose $4.92, or 6.8%, to $77.21.

The company agreed to sell its Energy, Chemicals and Resources segment to Australia’s WorleyParsons (WYGPY) for $3.3 billion, including $2.6 billion in cash and $700 million in WorleyParsons shares, in a deal that values the unit at 11.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

“While we like diverse ops and are not averse to energy exposure, we expect this transaction to be received very favorably by investors given continued wariness around engineering and construction energy exposure and attractive valuation for the divestment,” writes Keybanc’s Tahira Afzal, who reiterated an Overweight rating and $80 price target on the shares. “Our initial analysis suggests potential step up in value to the mid-$90s as investors reassess Jacob’s risk profile.”

Jacobs Engineering is up 17.1% year to date, and has risen 31.3% in the latest 12 months.

Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) fell to the bottom of the index, following a cautious analyst note that points to monotherapy (a focus on a single treatment) gains at rivals drug makers.

Newsletter Sign-up

Nektar lost $8.30, or 17.2%, to $39.89.

H. C. Wainwright analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay reiterated a Neutral rating on the shares, but warned that data presented by rival Roche (RHHBY) about its monotherapy activity at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting could spell trouble for Nektar. He writes that Nektar’s NKTR-214 cancer drug had no monotherapy activity, and competition from Roche and Eli Lilly (LLY) could further complicate the outlook for Nektar, as well as potentially “compel Nektar’s partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to re-evaluate the aggressive development strategy that was outlined earlier this year.”

Year to date, Nektar is down 33.2%, although it’s gained 65.1% in the latest 12 months.

What drove the market?

Investors will be wading through a flood of earnings this week as the third-quarter reporting season hits its stride. More than 150 companies are on tap to announce financial results.

Increased volatility has left investors nervous in what’s been a rough October. The S&P 500 is down more than 5% in the month-to-date, while the Dow is off 4.3% and the Nasdaq has shed more than 7%. That has left the S&P 500 roughly 6% off its record high set in late September.

Read: This troubling trend may wreak havoc on the stock market, analysts warn

Aside from earnings, worries about the impact of higher interest rates on the economy linger with the Federal Reserve indicating that it is likely to tighten monetary policy again by the end of the year.

What were analysts saying?

Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, told MarketWatch that “we have seen the narrative begin to shift,” to a more cautious one, citing fears over slowing global growth and whether U.S. companies can maintain their recent strong earnings growth in the quarters to come.

“Investors are anxious for more information,” he said, adding that while he believes the current backdrop is supportive of stocks, it will all some down to earnings. “With so many bellwether names across so many industries reporting this week, things should get interesting.”

“The rapid decline in stocks over the past two weeks, especially in large U.S. growth names [and] technology will take some time to repair,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management LLC, in a note to clients. “We have raised some cash over the past few weeks and are holding tight for now, but when the dust begins to settle we will move back into more conservative parts of the markets, which have been doing very well of late.”

What stocks were in focus?

Shares of Hasbro Inc. HAS, -6.04% fell 3.1% after the toy maker missed third-quarter profit and revenue expectations and announced a restructuring that will cut jobs.

Shares of Kimberly-Clark Corp. KMB, +0.37% declined 3.5% after posting lower profits and announcing a management shuffle.

Energy services company Halliburton Co. HAL, -1.44% topped third-quarter profit and revenue estimates but shares slid 3%.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -0.61% gained 5.8% ahead of its earnings announcement Wednesday. The chip maker has posted an impressive 145% return year-to-date, but pulled back in recent days over questions surrounding trade policy and how much more market share the firm can gain from rivals.

Shares of American Railcar Industries Inc. ARII, +0.20% soared 51% after the company announced said it would be acquired by a fund managed by investment firm ITE Managment LP. Under the terms of the deal, valued at $1.75 billion, ITE will pay $70 for each share of the company.

What data were in focus?

In a light day on the economic calendar, the Chicago Fed National Activity Index decreased to +0.17 in September from +0.27 in August.

How were other markets trading?

Chinese stocks surged on reassuring comments by leaders and regulators in the wake of last week’s market rout and disappointing economic data. The Shanghai SHCOMP, +0.81% closed 4.1% higher, while the smaller Shenzhen Composite 399106, +0.93% soared more than 5%.

Over the weekend, China President Xi Jinping emphasized China’s support for the private sector, according to the Xinhua News Agency, following concerted moves Friday by Vice Premier Liu He, Xi’s top economic official, and the head of the central bank and financial regulators to reassure investors.

"Dow, S&P fall as earnings season picks up; tech boosts Nasdaq","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow fell in choppy trading on Monday as energy and financial stocks lost ground and caution grew ahead of a slew of earnings reports this week.

Technology sector gains limited losses on the S&P 500 and helped to lift the Nasdaq. The beaten-down S&P technology index was up 0.8 percent.

The S&P 500 energy index sank 1.1 percent after Halliburton warned that fourth-quarter earnings would miss estimates amid ongoing weakness in the North American hydraulic fracturing market.

Halliburton fell 3 percent and rival oilfield services provider Schlumberger was down 2.9 percent.

“It’s a big earnings week,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.

“That’s causing some trepidation for investors. We’ve seen decent results but not universally, and there are some negative issues companies have talked about.”

While profits of S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 21.9 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, many investors are focusing on the outlook for future growth due to concerns over trade, rising costs and other factors.

Shares of Amazon.com and Alphabet, both due to report results this week, rose on Monday.

The Dow swung between gains and losses of more than 100 points early in the session, highlighting the volatility in U.S. equities as they struggle to recover from a recent sell-off even as the earnings season gathers steam.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 126.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,317.41, the S&P 500 lost 11.9 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,755.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.60 points, or 0.26 percent, to 7,468.63.

The S&P 500 remained below its 200-day moving average, a key technical level.

Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio, thinks the market will be more volatile and investors will lean toward being more cautious in the near term, at least ahead of the Nov. 6 U.S. midterm elections.

“People are looking at the negatives and saying that it’s a situation where there are more headwinds. At least until the midterms, it’s going to be difficult to make any significant progress on the upside. The drift will be lower,” he said.

Finiancial stocks fell 2.1 percent and were the biggest drag on the S&P 500. The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened to its lowest level in more than two weeks.

Early in the session, a surge in China stocks and positive sentiment across Europe on Moody’s decision to keep Italy’s sovereign rating outlook stable helped to support stocks.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 50 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 286 new lows.

About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 7.8 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv."
3M Company Reports Earnings Under a 'Death Cross',"3M Company (MMM) is a multi-national technology conglomerate that manufactures industrial, safety and consumer products including the ever-popular Post-it Notes. The stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and has been a significant laggard year to date.

3M stock closed Friday, Oct. 19, at $199.85, down 15.1% year to date and in bear market territory at 23.1% below its 2018 high of $259.77 set on Jan. 26. The stock is 4.9% above its 2018 low of $190.57 set on July 24. The Dow 30 is up 2.9% year to date and is 5.6% below its Oct. 3 all-time high of 26,951.81 set on Oct. 3. The Dow is 9% above its April 2 year-to-date low of 23,344.52.

Analysts expect 3M to report earnings per share of $2.70 when the company discloses its third quarter results before the opening bell on Oct. 23. A positive reaction to earnings led to the all-time intraday high of $259.77 on Jan. 26. A negative reaction to earnings on April 24 led to the May 1 low of $191.44. This was repeated on July 24, with the 2018 low of $190.57 set that day following earnings. 3M is expected to benefit from solid product offerings, but research and development costs remain a drag. The company also faces increased costs of retirement benefits, raw materials inflation and interest expenses.

The daily chart for 3M Company

The daily chart for 3M shows that a ""death cross"" was confirmed on April 30 when the 50-day simple moving average fell below the 200-day simple moving average, indicating that lower prices lay ahead. This negative was in play when the stock set its 2018 low of $190.57 on July 24. The stock tested its 200-day simple moving average of $216.34 on Oct. 3. The three horizontal lines from top to bottom are my quarterly risky level at $237.33, my semiannual risky level of $225.64 and my annual pivot of $220.75, last tested on April 18.

The weekly chart for 3M Company

The weekly chart for 3M is negative, with the stock below its five-week modified moving average of $206.10. The stock is above its 200-week simple moving average at $184.70, which is the ""reversion to the mean."" The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading fell to 63.80 last week, down from 74.23 on Oct. 12.

Given these charts and analysis, traders should buy 3M shares on weakness to the 200-week simple moving average of $184.70 and reduce holdings on strength to my annual, semiannual and quarterly risky levels of $220.75, $225.64 and $237.33, respectively."
Dow Jones Futures: More Leaders Break 50-Day Line In Stock Market Correction,"Dow Jones futures rose Monday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, getting a lift from a China stock rebound. It's still a stock market correction. The major averages closed last week little changed — the Dow Jones rose, the S&P 500 index was virtually flat and the Nasdaq composite edged lower — after promising gains early in the week. Worse, more growth stocks fell below key support areas. Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Match Group (MTCH), Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX) all fell below their 50-day lines by Friday's close.

X

The 50-day moving average is a key technical level. Top stocks often find support here, as mutual funds and other big investors step in to buy shares. While it's OK for a leading stock to dip below the 50-day line for a short span, you want to see it rebound soon. But in a stock market correction, most tickers will struggle, with growth names often falling further.

Stock Market Correction Is A Time To Watch

The lesson is clear. It is very hard to make money in a stock market correction, even during a rally attempt. During a stock market correction, build your watchlists. Wait until a follow-through day confirms a rally attempt. That could happen as soon as today or be weeks or months away. Then watch for leading stocks, some of which should be on your watchlists, break out into buy zones.

IBD'S TAKE: To stay in sync with the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks.

Boeing stock and TJX stock had avoided closing below their 50-day lines until Friday. Boeing, TJX, Ross stock and Apple stock, which nudged higher Friday, aren't far below that are. But AMD stock had held near its 50-day for several sessions, before crashing 11% Friday. Match stock skidded 6.4% Friday. Activision stock tumbled through its 50-day and 200-day lines on Thursday, then kept falling Friday.

Mind you, these are growth stocks that had been generally holding up better than most of their peers. Their relative strength lines, which track a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, are near record highs, aside from Activision.

Most 95+ Composite Rating Stocks Below 50-Day Line

All of those stocks, except for Activision, have IBD Composite Ratings of 95 or better. Apple stock and AMD stock boast best-possible 99 Composite Ratings. The Composite Rating combines several IBD proprietary ratings into a single score. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big runs.

Looking ahead to the coming week, there are 28 stocks with 95-plus Composite Ratings reporting earnings. They include Boeing stock and AMD stock, along with Amazon (AMZN), Centene (CNC), Visa (V), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), WWE (WWE) and many more. But just four are currently above their 50-day moving averages: iQvia (IQV), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Aon (AOC) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN).

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures rose 0.3% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.55% vs. fair value. Remember that Dow futures, Apple stock and other overnight action don't necessarily translate in actual trading in the next regular session.

That's been especially true during the stock market correction, with the major averages whipsawing during regular trading and sometimes overnight.

China's Shanghai composite jumped 4.1% Monday. On Friday, the People's Bank of China said it ""actively encourages policies to support the liquidity of businesses and is designing plans to support equity and bond financing of private enterprises.""

U.S.-listed Chinese stocks were higher in the premarket.
