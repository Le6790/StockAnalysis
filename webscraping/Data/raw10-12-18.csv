Stocks ended higher in a volatile session on Friday, Oct. 12 that saw major indexes open strong before giving up much of the day's gains in the middle of the day. Wall Street digested earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Citigroup Inc. (C) and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) .

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 287 points, or 1.15%, to 25,340. For the week, the Dow was off more than 1,000 points, or 4.2%. The S&P 500 gained 1.42%, ending a six-day losing streak. The Nasdaq ended up 2.29%.

Declines on Thursday, Oct. 11, had pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average's two-day losses to nearly 1,400 points and sent the Nasdaq into correction territory. The S&P 500 closed lower for a sixth straight day.

Investors have been rattled this week by higher bond yields, concerns over rising interest rates, trade tensions - particularly between the U.S. and China - and signs of slowing global economic growth. Yields on 10-year treasury notes were around 3.15% near the end of the day.

While a market rebound of some kind seemed likely Friday, volatility, as measured by the CBOE volatility index (VIX.X) , remains sharply higher than it has been in recent months. ""The VIX tells us to expect some big moves over the coming days until a trend develops,"" said Bob Lang, founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and a contributor to TheStreet.com's Trifecta Stocks Newsletter. The S&P 500 is still below its 200-day moving average, ""but if that is re-captured next week then there is a chance the uptrend can resume,"" Lang added. However, ""This week's heavy volume selling is not to be ignored.""

JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, said third-quarter profit rose 24% from a year earlier thanks to the Trump administration's tax cuts even as revenue in its juggernaut trading business slowed. Net income was $2.34 a share vs. estimates of $2.26.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon noted the increasing uncertainty for the banking business with the impact of Trump's $1.5 trillion of tax cuts expected to fade next year, widening U.S. government budget deficits that have ballooned the national debt past $21 trillion, rising U.S. interest rates and the president's trade conflicts with China, Europe and Japan.

""The U.S. and the global economy continue to show strength, despite increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, which at some point in the future may have negative effects on the economy,"" Dimon said.

Total revenue climbed by 5% to $27.8 billion, while expenses climbed by 7%, the bank said. The stock fell 0.8%.

Citigroup earned $1.73 a share in the third quarter, topping Wall Street's expectations by 5 cents. Revenue of $18.39 billion came in just shy of estimates. The stock rose 2%.

Wells Fargo gained 1.3% on Friday. The bank's third-quarter adjusted profit was $1.16 a share, 3 cents below estimates.

By MARLEY JAY, AP Markets Writer

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks rebounded Friday, clawing back some of the week's steep losses, but the turbulent trading of the last few days left no doubt that the relative calm the markets enjoyed all summer had been shattered.

Major U.S. indexes ended the week down about 4 percent, their worst weekly loss in six months. An index measuring the performance of small-company stocks had its worst week since early 2016.

Big technology and consumer-focused companies led the recovery Friday. Longtime favorites of many investors, they had plunged in the last few days.

A major factor cited by market watchers for the pullback was a sharp increase in interest rates, which can slow the economy and make bonds more attractive to investors relative to stocks.

Apple climbed 3.6 percent to $222.11 and Microsoft gained 3.5 percent to $109.57. Amazon jumped 4 percent to $1,788.41. Those are the three most valuable companies in the U.S., and they suffered startling declines the last few days: on Wednesday each took its biggest loss in more than two years. That made for a dramatic end to three months of calm on the U.S. market.

The S&P 500 index rose 38.76 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,767.13 to end a six-day losing streak. The benchmark index tumbled 4.1 percent this week, and it's down 5.6 percent since from its latest record high, set Sept. 20. Thanks in part to the big gain for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite jumped 167.83 points, or 2.3 percent, to 7,496.89.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 414 points early on, then gave it all up and turned slightly lower. It rebounded and finished with a gain of 287.16 points, or 1.1 percent, at 25,339.99.

The market's recent skid started last week, when strong economic data and positive comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell helped set off a wave of selling in the bond market as investors they bet that the U.S. economy would keep growing at a healthy pace. That pushed bond prices lower and sent yields up to seven-year highs.

That drove interest rates sharply higher, which worried stock investors who felt that a big increase could stifle economic growth. The big swings in the market Friday suggest those fears haven't gone away. The VIX, a measurement of how much volatility investors expect, hasn't been this high in six months.

""What seems to have driven this is a fear interest rates were going to rise more quickly because the Fed was being too aggressive or the economy was going to overheat,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds. Kelly said he doesn't think either of those fears is justified, as the Fed isn't raising interest rates that rapidly and economic growth hasn't sped up recently.

Small companies didn't fare as well. The Russell 2000 index rose just 1.30 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,546.68 to wrap up its largest loss in one week since January 2016. High-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate investment trusts also rose less than the rest of the market. They held up relatively well over the past few days. Investors view them as relatively safe, steady assets that look better when growth is uncertain and the rest of the market is in turmoil.

U.S. automakers Ford and General Motors continued to slump. GM shed 1.6 percent to $31.79, its lowest in almost two years. Ford, trading at its lowest in almost nine years, dipped 1.9 percent to $8.64. Both have plunged this year as they deal with slowing sales and the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum, which are sending their manufacturing costs higher.

The stocks have fallen further in recent days following reports Ford might cut jobs. In late September, Ford CEO Jim Hackett said the steel and aluminum duties would cost the company $1 billion through 2019.

Investors are also growing more concerned that U.S.-China trade tensions are impairing global economic growth. The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global economic growth this week because of trade tensions and increased interest rates.

Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for CFRA, said he thought stocks fell too far, but there could be more turmoil ahead for the markets. While stocks had done well in spite of the rising trade tensions between China and the U.S., investors seem more worried now.

""Everybody has been pretty much dismissing the effect of the trade war on U.S. equities, and now they're beginning to think 'wait a minute, maybe there could be a problem,'"" he said. ""I don't think the reasons for the decline have been resolved.""

Bond prices edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.15 percent 3.13 percent. At the beginning of the year it stood at 2.46 percent.

U.S. crude oil added 0.5 percent to $71.34 a barrel in in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, picked up 0.2 percent to $80.43 a barrel in London.

Wholesale gasoline rose 0.5 percent to $1.94 a gallon. Heating oil fell 0.5 percent to $2.32 a gallon. Natural gas lost 1.9 percent to $3.16 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Asian stocks also rebounded. Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.5 percent after sinking early in the day and following a nearly 4 percent loss on Thursday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 2.1 percent and the Kospi in South Korea rose 1.5 percent.

European stocks finished mostly lower. The French CAC 40 dipped 0.2 percent and so did the FTSE 100 in Britain. The DAX in Germany slipped 0.1 percent.

After a big jump Thursday, gold lost 0.5 percent to $1,222 an ounce. Silver rose 0.2 percent to $14.64 an ounce. Copper slipped 0.1 percent to $2.80 a pound.

The dollar slipped to 112.01 yen from 111.94 yen. The euro fell to $1.1563 from $1.1594.

"Dow ends higher Friday, but can't erase week's rout","Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York on Oct. 11, 2018. (Photo: Justin Lane, EPA-EFE)

Market watchers can go into the weekend thinking it could have been a lot worse.

Stocks pulled off a strong showing Friday, but the rally wasn’t quite enough to recoup the steep losses from an earlier two-day rout.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 287.16 points, or 1.15 percent, to close at 25,339.99. Still, the blue-chip index shed 1,107 points this week, its worst since March. On Wednesday, the index dropped more than 800 points, the biggest loss since February.

Other indexes, while making gains Friday, had similar bad weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 4.1 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq – hardest hit in Wednesday’s battering – ended the week down 3.74 percent.

The Russell 2000’s performance was the worst, however. The small-company stocks index fell into official correction territory Thursday and ended the week 11.16 percent off its Aug. 31 peak.

“Obviously, it was a tough week. The good news is things have stabilized today and, while we’re off from the day’s highs, the rebound was broad,” said Chris Cook, founder and president of Beacon Capital Management. “That’s a good sign heading into the weekend.”

Anxiety over a jump in interest rates coupled with the uncertain impact of Chinese tariffs on the economy ignited the sell-off Wednesday. Tech darlings got hammered hard two days ago but rebounded with noise Friday. Amazon gained 4.03 percent, Apple increased 3.57 percent and Netflix jumped 5.75 percent.

The biggest losers were trade-prone stocks such as Caterpillar, Boeing and 3M, which all lost almost 7 percent this week.

“We are moving away from a market driven by low interest rates to one that is based more on fundamentals, so companies dependent on borrowing for growth – like tech stocks – look less attractive,” said Timothy Chubb, CIO at Univest Wealth Management Division. “Investors are getting accustomed to that.”

Timing also exacerbated the sell-off, Chubb said. For the last year, corporations have been some of the bigger purchasers of stocks, buying back their own shares. But they are barred from doing that ahead of reporting their own earnings, which traditionally occurs in October. That doesn't help a slumping market, Chubb said.

By Friday, the interest rate and tariff fears seemed to abate. U.S. consumer prices in September came in lower than expected at 0.1 percent Thursday, suggesting that inflation isn’t ramping up. The Federal Reserve hikes rates to tamp down inflationary pressures.

On the trade front, tensions appeared to dissipate some after reports that President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will meet at the G-20 summit in November. An import-export report from China also showed trade remained robust, even with the U.S.

The fundamentals of the economy also remain strong and should dissuade investors from bolting for the door, said Joe Wirbick, president of Sequinox, a financial planning firm in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. For instance, the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, among other encouraging factors.

""Just because the market has been on the rise for such a long time doesn't mean the race is over,"" Wirbick said. ""Markets shift. That's just life.""

The stock market’s nightmare may be far from over,"Everett Collection It’s a scary time for stock investors.

After a nail-biting week with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking nearly 1,400 points over two sessions, the jury is still out on whether the selloff signals a fundamental shift in the stock market or a brief episodic correction.

But one thing is certain: Investors should brace for more market drama in the coming days as corporate earnings, rising interest rates and economic data all converge to create an angst-ridden trading backdrop.

Stocks bounced back decisively on Friday with major indexes finishing in positive territory even though they were sharply lower for the week. The fact the market closed on a strong note heading into the weekend negates some of the “technical damage” wrought earlier, according to Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James.

But the mood on Wall Street was one of caution rather than euphoria.

Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Canaccord Genuity, believes the market may not have found its bottom yet.

“When you get this kind of correction in the broad equity market and surge in volatility, there is typically a bit more downside — either right away or on a retest,” he said in a Friday tweet.

It certainly has not been pretty. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.82% fell 5.1% in the first two weeks of October, its worst start to a fourth quarter since 2008. When the large-cap index drops 5% or more during the first 10 trading days of a quarter, it falls 79% of the time for an average quarterly decline of 11.3%, according to the Dow Jones Data Group.

Still, Dwyer told MarketWatch that he is not revising his upbeat outlook.

“Nope, haven’t changed it yet,” he said, sticking with his year-end target of 3,200 for the large cap index.

To be sure, investors may have been lulled into a false sense of complacency with the S&P 500 not having had a 1% move in 74 days until things went haywire on Wednesday. Yet, market observers were quick to point out that dramatic swings are a normal part of trading and investors should prepare for volatility to pick up going forward.

“We believe investors should expect a more normal amount of volatility from stocks versus what we experienced when interest rates were at their ultra-low levels, since higher yields on bonds and short-term cash now provide a better competitor to stocks,” said Bill Stone, co-chief investment officer at Avalon Advisors LLC, in a note to clients.

Since 1928, the S&P 500 has logged a 5% decline about every two months and a 10% drop every six months.

“On average the S&P 500 has experienced intrayear declines of almost 14% since 1980 despite going on to post annual gains in over 75% of those 38 years,” he said.

And higher volatility is not necessarily the bogeyman that it’s made out to be.

Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, reiterated his bullish call on stocks, pointing out that investing in times of volatility spikes pays off.

Credit Suisse

The Cboe Volatility index VIX, -3.83% also known as Wall Street’s fear index, soared to above 28 this week, a level it had not traded at since February.

Aside from earnings, a slew of economic data from retail sales to industrial production as well as FOMC minutes are likely to provide a more in-depth look into the state of the economy with the Federal Reserve widely expected to hike interest rates again by the end the year.

But in the wake of the market’s blood-letting, Matthew Luzzetti, senior economist at Deutsche Bank, suggested that the Fed could back off from its hawkish stance if stocks continue to swoon.

“All else equal, a further 10% decline in equities, which would amount to a roughly 15% decline from the recent peak, that would erase this year’s gains, would be needed to tighten financial conditions by enough to materially impact the Fed,” he said in a report.

When all is said and done, it’s worth noting that the historic crashes of 1929, 1987, and 2008 happened in October and things could get even more choppy this year due to a number of factors, according to Jeff Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader’s Almanac.

Jeff Hirsch

“We may get some more downside this year than the average October, but with all the midterm machinations, Fed activity, frothy sentiment and rich valuations that is understandable,” he wrote in a recent blog post.

Dow soars 287 points but still suffers worst week since March,"New York (CNN Business) The stock market is on the comeback trail.

After another wobbly session, the Dow soared 287 points, or 1.2%, on Friday. It was the index's best day since August.

The Dow had soared 400 points at the open before giving up most of those gains and then resuming its rally. The Dow lost 1,378 points over Wednesday and Thursday.

The broader S&P 500 jumped 1.4% on Friday. The Nasdaq, which has taken the brunt of the recent stock market turbulence, spiked 2.3%.

Despite Friday's rebound, all three major indexes suffered their worst weeks since March. And the S&P 500 is down three straight weeks. That hasn't happened since the Brexit referendum of June 2016.

Investing experts weren't exactly sure what turned stocks negative by midday. The driving forces behind this week's downturn -- trade war and interest rate fears -- were around before this week, and yet market volatility is spiking.

""The sellers have control right now,"" said Justin Walters, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. ""The scariest sell offs are the ones you can't tie to a specific reason.""

Stocks had turned sharply south over the past week because investors are concerned about rising interest rates. As the Federal Reserve raises rates to keep the economy from overheating, investors have been getting out of bonds, driving down their price and driving up their yields. Suddenly, the return on bonds has become competitive with some stocks — particularly risky tech stocks.

Rising interest rates also increase borrowing costs for households and businesses, eating into corporate profits.

""What we are seeing now is changing sands. The ground isn't stable and people are figuring out where to go next,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist with TD Ameritrade.

Tech stocks have come under fire because they are some of the riskiest and most expensive parts of the market. Investors fear that tech companies may not hold up well in a downturn, particularly as interest rates spike. A proxy for the tech sector had its sharpest plunge in seven years on Wednesday.

But Big Tech on Friday regained some of its losses. Facebook ( FB ), Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Netflix ( NFLX ) and Google ( GOOGL ) were all up.

Asian and European markets also came back Friday . The Hang Seng soared 2.2%. Stocks in Shanghai rose 0.9% and the Nikkei rose 0.5%. Stocks in London, Germany and France all rose about a half percentage point.

Markets had bounced back Friday morning following news that President Donald Trump plans to meet next month with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit. That eased some of investors' fears about another trade war escalation. China also reported reported its exports rose nearly 15% in September , stronger than expected. That suggests China is weathering the first waves of new tariffs that the Trump administration imposed on $50 billion of Chinese exports this summer.

But Kinahan is still worried about US-China trade talks. He thinks that a deal is key in order for the markets to get back on track, adding that a full-blown trade war could undo much of the positives from the Trump administration's pro-business policies.

""The concern is that if nobody blinks, it could negate all the tax cuts we had,"" he said.

Earnings season also kicked off Friday morning, with JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Citigroup ( C ) reporting their quarterly finances before the bell. Wall Street analysts expected the financial sector to post another incredibly profitable quarter — and JPMorgan managed to beat their already lofty expectations

In times of market turbulence, there's nothing like soaring profits to calm investors' nerves.

Rebounds after disastrous market selloffs are common. Investors who think the market may be oversold look to buy stocks they think are suddenly cheap.

But markets are fickle."
Dow regains some of this week's losses,"After a harrowing week for financial markets, investors will look for solid corporate earnings reports and healthy economic news over the next few weeks to calm things down.

This week, sharply higher bond yields, fears of faster rate hikes, and the prospect of a long trade war between the United States and China prompted a two-day rout in the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,300 points on Wednesday and Thursday.

Even as the Dow regained almost 300 of those points Friday, some experts said investors’ concerns haven’t been resolved. But if fresh evidence emerges that the economy remains healthy and growing, and companies are still churning out robust profit gains, the stock market may eventually push aside those fears.

“The basic question everybody has to ask is, has the fundamental situation deteriorated or not?” said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds. “Unless something else goes wrong, volatility will ultimately settle down and stocks will move up.”

The third-quarter earnings season will intensify in the coming weeks and should show whether profit growth remains strong despite the market’s worries. Earnings are projected to grow nearly 20 percent from a year earlier, a healthy gain if slightly below the previous two quarters.

That could be a tough hurdle to clear: 74 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index have already said their earnings will come in below analysts’ estimates. That’s more companies than normally issue such warnings.

“Keep in mind that the analysts have set the bar really high for the (third quarter) earnings season,” David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, wrote in a note to clients.

Just as importantly as the numbers, investors will focus on what company executives say about the impact of the U.S.-China trade fight, higher interest rates, and other challenges facing the economy. Talk of threats to future profit growth could jar investors and offset any positive vibe from good numbers for the quarter just past.

The trade issue “is going to be a huge focus,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.

That’s because it’s still not clear what the long-run impact of the tariffs will be. Will American multinationals, such as Caterpillar, Apple and GM, start to shift some of their production out of China? Will they start to raise prices on more products to offset the cost of the duties?

“Breaking down global supply chains is inflationary,” Rosenberg said.

Those concerns are rising because economists increasingly expect the Trump administration’s fight with China to continue for the foreseeable future. Many investors and business executives have previously assumed that the administration’s tariffs were intended to win short-term concessions.

But unlike Trump’s other fights with countries like Canada, which focus on specific tariffs and specific products, the administration’s complaints with China are centered on more sweeping issues such as intellectual property rights and that country’s industrial policy.

“We expect this to be quite protracted,” Joy said. “These are really big, strategic geopolitical issues that aren’t easily solved.”

President Trump and China’s President Xi Jingping are now scheduled to meet at an international financial summit in late November. If the two leaders can agree at that meeting to hold off on further import taxes while they iron out their differences, that could give the markets a boost, Joy said.

Some economic reports next week may also assuage investors’ concerns — or fuel them. A report on retail and restaurant sales will show if consumers are still spending at a healthy clip. Expectations are high: Analysts forecast that sales grew 0.6 percent in September, after barely expanding the previous month.

And on Friday, the National Association of Realtors will report on sales of existing homes last month. Sales have fallen 1.5 percent in the past year, as sharp price increases have outpaced wage gains, leaving many potential home-buyers unable to afford a purchase.

And now mortgage rates have jumped to their highest level in seven years, making houses less affordable. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to 4.9 percent this week, from 3.9 percent a year ago.

The retail and home sales data could be disrupted by the impact of Hurricane Florence, which tore through the Carolinas in September. Hurricane Michael won’t show up in the data until next month.

Still, economists forecast that home sales in September will decline again.

Slowing housing sales have already worried some economists, who see it as a sign that the economic expansion may not last that much longer.

“I think of housing as the canary in the coal mine,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton."
Dow wipes out a more than 400-point opening gain to briefly turn negative in powerful reversal,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost steam in midday action Friday, with the blue-chip index shedding much of its intraday gain to turn momentarily negative. The Dow DJIA, +0.79% most recently, was up 70 points, or 0.3% at 25,126. The index had been up by as many as 414 points, or 1.7%, at the start of trading, signaling that a powerful rebound from a two-session rout may be at hand. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.82% was trading with a gain of 0.5% at 2,741, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% was up 1.1%. All three benchmarks were well off their best levels of the session. Friday's action comes after the Dow shed roughly 1,400 points between Wednesday and Thursday. That sharp drop prompted by growing fears about rapidly rising interest rates has left the equity gauges in position to post their worst weekly losses since March. For the Dow, shares of Boeing Co. [s; BA], were creating a roughly 20-point headwind for the benchmark on Friday.

Dow Gains 170 Points as Stocks Rage Against the Dying of the Light,"Text size

6:35 a.m. Stocks are trying to come back from their worst start to a quarter in years. Which is exactly what we’d be expected.

S&P 500 futures have 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have 170 points, or 0.7%. Nasdaq Composite futures have climbed 1.4%.

Why the drop. “While there was a litany of excuses—including higher rates, a more hawkish Fed, midterm elections, and trade—none of them explained the selloff,” writes Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Golub. “Historically, investing on volatility spikes leads to above average returns in subsequent months. We reiterate our bullish market call and TECH+ overweight, and believe that investors should opportunistically extend risk against this higher volatility.”

Time will tell if he’s right."
"Trouble lurks in the stock market, with one-third of S&P 500 trading in bear territory","CLOSE The Dow plunged more than 800 points Wednesday, its worst drop in eight months.

Damage assessments from the recent market slump are rolling in, and stock losses are more gruesome and bigger than they appear on the surface.

The downfall of many individual stocks has been far more sizable than the broad stock market's discomforting but manageable 7 percent drop from its late September high, data show.

Big time troubles for the struggling bull market lurk in the deeper pool of companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. Shares of many of them are in full retreat, with 165 companies, or one-third of the index, now in bear market territory.

That means their stock prices are down more than 20 percent from their recent highs, according to Bloomberg data through Friday morning.

In dollar terms, investors suffered a paper loss of $2.5 trillion on U.S. stocks from the market's record high on September 20 through Thursday, according to Wilshire Associates.

""It has been a really rough start to the fourth quarter,"" says Thomas Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, a New York-based investment firm.

A confluence of factors is spooking investors: fears of rising interest rates; trade tensions with China; and a feeling that the strong earnings and healthy economy can only get worse, not better.

""We just dropped 1,400 Dow points in two days, (but) the average stock is much, much worse,"" says Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum Capital Management. ""It tells you how much real weakness there has been.""

Among S&P 500 companies, shares of Newell Brands, the maker of Sharpie markers, Coleman coolers and Rawlings baseball gloves, have fallen the most from their most recent high: 59 percent.

Many of the other big losers are stocks that are sensitive to rising interest rates or fallout from tariffs. Still others are former high-flyers that were prime candidates for investors to cash out of when the market plunged.

Here's a glance at the fallen:

Stocks hurt by spiking borrowing costs

One slice of the market weighed down by higher interest rates is home-building companies. The shares of Lennar and Pulte Group are down 40 percent and 34 percent, respectively, from their recent highs. Their home-buying clients will pay more now that mortgages carry higher interest rates. The rate on the 30-year fixed-rate home loan -- the most popular mortgage for purchases -- recently ticked above 5 percent for the first time since early 2011. That makes it more challenging for people already facing higher prices and low inventory to afford a home.

Analysts fear that automakers like Ford Motor, whose stock is down nearly 35 percent from its recent high, and General Motors, which is down more than 30 percent, will also suffer from weaker sales due to higher financing costs for new and used cars.

Both companies' businesses have also been dinged by the rising cost of commodities, largely due to President Trump's 25 percent tariff on imported steel. Back in July, GM reported $300 million in increased commodity costs in the second quarter. Similarly, Ford said tariffs resulted in $145 million in higher costs and could rise to as much as $600 million for the full year.

Shares upended by tariffs

It's not just automakers being hurt by tariffs. Home appliance maker Whirlpool, whose shares are down 44 percent from their recent high, downgraded its full-year profit outlook in July. The gloomier forecast was based in part on an increase of $200 million in raw material costs because of the 25 percent import tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum.

Shares of Harley-Davidson are down more than 27 percent. Back in June, the iconic motorcycle maker said it would incur added costs of $45 million to $55 million this year due to trade disputes.

The San Francisco company Twitter announced on September 12, 2013, in a tweet, that it has submitted papers for a stock offering, the most hotly anticipated in the tech sector since Facebook's last year. ""We've confidentially submitted an S-1 to the SEC for a planned IPO. This Tweet does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale,"" the company tweeted. Talk of an initial public offering (IPO) has circulated about Twitter for some time, and the Wall Street Journal estimated the company founded in 2006 is worth some $10 billion. Twitter has become one of the fastest-growing and most influential social media services, used widely by celebrities, journalists, politicians and others.

Market darlings abandoned by followers

Popular tech stocks have also suffered steep declines. Investors are bailing out of these once-high-flying stocks in an effort to take profits and flee to parts of the market that they believe will hold up better in a downturn.

Shares of Twitter are down more than 43 percent from their recent high, Facebook is down nearly 30 percent, and video streaming service Netflix is 24 percent lower. The stock prices of Twitter and Facebook, whose top executives were recently grilled by federal lawmakers about user privacy issues and foreign manipulation of U.S. elections, have also come under pressure over fears of coming government regulation.

""It's not surprising to see a rotation out of high-flying names and into less-aggressive stocks,"" says Amanda Agati, co-chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services Group.

CLOSE Bear Market is a term that sends fear into Wall Street and investors. What does it mean? And how does it affect both Wall Street and Main Street? Adam Shell explains.

3 Reasons You Shouldn’t Worry About Wednesday’s 832-Point Drop in the Dow -- The Motley Fool,"As you might already know, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 832 points on Wednesday. This was the third-largest number of points the Dow has shed in a single trading session ever.

However, there's a lot more to that last sentence than meets the eye. In fact, despite the negative tones you might hear from market commentators on television, this move is no reason to panic. Here are three reasons I'm not at all worried about the recent market plunge and why you shouldn't be either.

This isn't even a major drop, historically speaking

Sure, the headline ""Dow Drops 832 Points"" looks scary, and commentators are quick to point out that it's the ""third-largest"" drop in history, but it's important to take a step back. Market plunges like this have indeed happened many times before.

The number 832 is high, but that's just because the Dow is close to a record high level right now. In terms of the percentage of the loss, Wednesday's 3.3% drop really isn't too bad. In fact, it isn't close to being one of the worst market plunges in history -- the plunge would have needed to be nearly 7% to even be in the top 20.

The point: Don't get too worked up over dramatic-sounding headlines after the market drops. Swings of 3% (or more) in single trading days aren't exactly rare. They've occurred many times throughout history and will certainly occur many times throughout the coming decades as well.

Moves like this are a normal part of a healthy stock market

Over the past 15 years, the worst time to invest would have been shortly before the financial crisis and Great Recession in 2008. If you invested $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund at the start of 2008, before the financial crisis hit, how much do you think your investment would be worth now?

Here's some context. Since January 1, 2008, the S&P 500 has experienced 17 of its 20 largest one-day point declines in history, including four days when it dropped by 7% or more. And that's on top of a steady downward trend during 2008 and part of 2009 when the index lost 54% of its value altogether.

With this in mind, it might surprise you to learn that a $10,000 S&P index fund investment would have grown to more than $23,700 today. In other words, if you had invested in the stock market at the worst possible time in the past 15 years, you would have more than doubled your money.

The point is that moves like this are a normal part of a healthy stock market, and lots of money has been made over the years by long-term investors who largely ignore what the stock market is doing on a day-to-day basis.

Stocks just went on sale

To be clear, I don't suggest buying stocks just because their prices went down. Having said that, if you believe in a company for the long run and the drop had nothing to do with the company's business or future potential, a stock market drop is like a sale.

Consider Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as an example. I've been considering adding Netflix to my portfolio for some time, but I thought the stock's price had become a little overheated recently. Well, in Wednesday's market plunge, Netflix lost 8.4% of its share price. Since Oct. 1, Netflix is down by roughly 15%.

Now, is Netflix inherently worth 15% less than it was just 11 days ago? Of course not. Think of it this way: If a new suit you'd been looking at that was a bit on the pricey end was marked down by 15%, it would look like a more compelling buy. The same logic applies to market drops like we saw this week.

In a nutshell, here's why you shouldn't worry:"
