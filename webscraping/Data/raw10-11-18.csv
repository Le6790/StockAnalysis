"U.S. stocks close lower as Dow drops nearly 1,400 points in 2 days","U.S. stocks extended losses to finish lower Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing nearly 1,400 points over two days as investors continued to fret over rising bond yields and the prospect of higher interest rates.

How did major benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.79% tumbled 545.91 points, or 2.1%, to 25,052.83, bringing its two-day decline to 1,378 points.

The S&P 500 SPX, +0.82% lost 57.31 points, or 2.1%, to 2,728.37. The benchmark fell for a sixth straight day, its longest losing streak since a nine-day drop that ended in November 2016. All 11 primary S&P 500 sectors were lower, led by the energy and financials sectors.

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% shed 92.99 points, or 1.3%, to 7,329.06 after briefly dropping into correction territory.

All three indexes ended below their 200-day moving averages, a closely watched metric for long-term momentum trends.

The Russell 2000 RUT, +0.52% an index for small caps, finished in correction territory after falling 27.27 points, or 1.7%, to 1,547.83.

On Wednesday, the Dow and the S&P suffered their biggest one-day drop since February, while the Nasdaq had its biggest slump since June 2016. The decline took the major indexes below key levels, which could be a catalyst for additional selling ahead.

What drove the market?

Investors have pinned the selloff on a variety of factors, including a sudden rise in long-dated interest rates since late September. A bond-market selloff saw the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% top 3.26% earlier this week for the first time since April 2011.

Higher yields raise borrowing costs for corporations. They also divert investment away from stocks. Market turmoil, however, appeared to spark haven demand for U.S. bonds, with the yield on the 10-year note down more than 6 basis points to 3.158%.

President Donald Trump stepped up his criticism of the Fed late Wednesday, blaming the central bank’s rate-hiking efforts for the stock-market weakness. Some analysts argue the Fed’s expected rate path is overly aggressive, while others contend strong underlying economic fundamentals justify the central bank’s outlook.

Continuing trade tensions with China and concerns about global growth have also been cited as factors behind the equity market’s downturn.

In the latest economic data, jobless claims rose by 7,000 in the latest week, although they remain near multidecade lows. Separately, the consumer-price index rose 0.1% in September. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, rose at the same pace.

What were analysts saying?

“It’s more of the same from yesterday,” said Sahak Manuelian, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities, who said Thursday’s market action was dominated by short-term players. “There are a bunch of nimble guys who tried to see if they can move some stocks higher but when that failed, sales picked up,” he said.

Manuelian also noted that the narrative of higher rates and U.S.-China trade tension have not changed and it is likely to take a while for the negative sentiment to work itself out.

“We have to remember that days like this can see the algos wreak havoc,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, referring to large automated trading orders. She also believes comments by Jeff Gundlach, chief executive of Doubleline Capital, that interest rates could rise further contributed to deteriorating market sentiment.

Gundlach has been predicting a move higher for rates after the 30-year Treasury yield closed above 3.25% two days in a row last week.

The market losses are “a reaction from investors finally realizing we are in a higher interest-rate environment, and given the elevated level of stocks, market participants were likely looking for a reason to sell,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. “Higher interest rates typically bring on tighter financial conditions which could dampen growth going forward and equity markets are reacting to that.”

He added, “we are witnessing the repercussions in the markets as the Fed takes the punch bowl away from the party.”

"Stocks plunge again on wide selling, Dow Jones average drops another 545 points","- U.S. stocks sank more than 2 percent Thursday, the second day of steep declines around the globe driven by concerns about rising interest rates and trade tensions.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 546 points after dropping 831 points Wednesday. The two-day loss of 5.3 percent is the biggest for Dow since February. The S&P 500 is also down more than 5 percent over the two days and had declined for six straight days.

The selling was widespread. Energy companies sank along with oil prices and CVS lead a rout in health care stocks. Technology companies and retailers, including longtime market favorites Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, extended their recent slide.

Seeking safety, investors bought gold and government bonds. That pushed prices up and yields down, ending a surge in yields that had touched off the market's current decline. But investors found more things to worry about.

There are ongoing concerns about the unresolved trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Strong earnings reports in the coming weeks could soothe investor nerves, but negative comments from company executives about future profits could have the opposite effect. Recently a larger-than-normal number of companies have warned that their third-quarter results could be weaker than analysts expected.

The benchmark S&P 500 index rose in morning trading, but ultimately gave up 57.31 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,728.37, its lowest close in three months. The index fell 3.3 percent Wednesday and has declined 6.7 percent during its current losing streak. That's its steepest downturn since a 10-percent drop in early February.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 545.91 points, or 2.1 percent, to 25,052.83 after falling as much as 698. The Nasdaq composite skidded 92.99 points, or 1.3 percent, to 7,329.06. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 30.03 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,545.38.

Thursday's losses in the U.S. followed steep declines overseas. France's CAC 40 and the British FTSE 100 both sank 1.9 percent and the DAX in Germany lost 1.5 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gave up 3.9 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 3.5 percent. The Kospi in South Korea fell 4.4 percent.

""People are trying to get a sense of 'where should my money actually be right now?'"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade.

The S&P 500's current decline is the longest since a nine-day skid shortly before the 2016 presidential election. It has climbed 27.5 percent since Donald Trump was elected.

On Thursday, President Trump renewed his criticism of the Federal Reserve, blaming the recent downturn in the stock market on the Fed's rate policy.

""We have interest rates going up at a clip that's much faster than certainly a lot of people, including myself, would have anticipated. I think the Fed is out of control,"" the president said to reporters in the Oval Office.

Trump said he had no intention of firing Jerome Powell, who he appointed as Fed chairman in February.

Bond prices rose as the recent surge in yields attracted the attention of some investors. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.15 percent from 3.22 percent late Wednesday. That's still sharply higher than it was about a week ago, and earlier this week the yield on the 10-year note reached its highest level since mid-2011.

The drop in yields hurt banks, and JPMorgan Chase fell 3 percent to $1078.13 while Bank of America sank 3 percent to $28.36. JPMorgan Chase and several other banks will report their third-quarter results Friday morning.

Technology and retail companies continued to stumble. Amazon dropped another 2 percent to $1,719.36 and Apple fell 0.9 percent to $214.45. Microsoft and Alphabet, Google's parent company, were little changed. Those stocks have made huge gains for years, but they're currently out of favor. Amazon and Alphabet, respectively the second- and fourth-most valuable U.S. companies, are in what's known as a ""correction,"" a drop of more than 10 percent from a recent peak. Facebook, the sixth-largest company, has tumbled 29 percent since late July, surpassing the 20-percent threshold for a ""bear market.""

The Nasdaq composite has fallen 9.6 percent since it set a record high in late August and the Russell 2000 has fallen 11 percent.

U.S. crude dropped 3 percent to $70.97 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 3.4 percent to $80.26 a barrel in London. After months of declines, the price of gold jumped by the most in two years, rising 2.9 percent to $1,227.60 an ounce.

Wholesale gasoline lost 4.3 percent to $1.93 a gallon. Heating oil shed 2.6 percent to $2.33 a gallon. Natural gas fell 1.9 percent to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet.

In other metals trading, silver rose 2 percent to $14.61 an ounce and copper added 0.8 percent to $2.80 a pound.

The dollar fell to 111.94 yen from 112.59 yen, and the euro rose to $1.1594 from $1.1525.

Is the Dow Jones' Drop the Start of the Next Stock Market Crash?,"The Dow is in the middle of a 1,200-point slide over the last week, which has investors wondering if this is the start of the next stock market crash.

To help Money Morning readers make sense of the recent decline, we want to show you exactly what's driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average's fall and what it means for your money.

Today, we'll examine two of the key factors responsible for the Dow's fall and if it signals the start of a larger downturn.

We'll also show you a way to protect your investments if this week's decline turns into a full-blown stock market crash…

Volatile Trade Relations and Interest Rate Hikes are Sending Markets into Free Fall

As tech stocks fall in the face of mounting downward pressure, many investors are concerned that this week's drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is on the beginning of a coming stock market crash.

There are two key factors that could turn these fears into an unpleasant reality.

The first is continued escalation in the trade war between the United States and China.

The latest trade war valley is weighing on stocks this week. Last Sunday (Oct. 7), Beijing announced that it intends to cut China's reserve requirement ratio by 100 bias points.

This means that Chinese banks will have to keep far less cash in reserve than they have traditionally.

Prospering During a Financial Crisis: Incredible wealth-building opportunity for those who are prepared – quickly amass a potential $1.5 million retirement nest egg. Learn more…

Experts argue that this surprise move by China is intended devalue the nation's currency.

On the whole, they're right – the ratio cut is expect to dump $750 billion yuan into China's economy. That's roughly $109.2 billion American dollars.

With more money flowing through the Chinese economy, Chinese goods and services become less expensive relative to American goods and services. That makes China more competitive on the global market and harms American industry.

However, the government's ratio cut is also a flashing red light for the Chinese economy.

A cash injection of this magnitude indicates that China's economy is slowing due to pressure from recent American trade measures.

China is the world's largest developing economy and the United States' largest trading partner. Any breakdown of Chinese economic growth will undermine the global economy's health.

And the threat of that breakdown is sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average into the red.

Second, higher interest rates are also fueling the Dow's drastic decline.

That's because interest rates often create resistance for future economic growth.

You see, companies that need to borrow in order to fund their growth are required to use more of their existing capital to fund that growth when interest rates rise.

As a result, they have less money on hand and tighter margins. And this can prevent them from making the kind of investments that spur economic expansion.

And that's bad for investor returns in much the same way slowing jobs growth is.

In spite of these pessimistic indicators, it is still too early in the market's decline to know if this week's significant losses are the first signs of a stock market crash.

Remember, a stock market correction – at least a 10% decline in stocks – is entirely normal and even healthy for markets.

And we simply won't know if this is the start of a 2018 stock market crash or is simply a short-term downturn until it's too late.

That's exactly why you should be prepared for either scenario.

Fortunately, now is the perfect time to follow our stock market crash protection plan….

"Dow Jones Falls, Shows 3-Day Loss Of More Than 1,400 Points","The rout on Wall Street continued in stocks today, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling as much as 2.7% intraday and clawing back just a small part of those heavy losses. By session end, the blue chip benchmark dropped 2.1%.

X

The 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average undercut the critical long-term 200-day moving average, which continues to slope higher. It last dropped through the 200-day line June 25, but managed to rebound.

At least 14 of the components in the Dow Jones industrials fell 2 points or more, led by Boeing (BA). The aerospace giant, part of IBD Leaderboard, sank 2.4% to mark a sixth straight loss. The stock is showing institutional buying support at the 50-day moving average. But at 358, Boeing is now more than 4% below a 374.58 buy point in a 3-1/2-month flat base.

The S&P 500 dropped 2.1%, adding to Wednesday's 3.3% sell-off. It sliced below the 200-day moving average. The Nasdaq composite fell nearly 1.3% and is now almost 10% below an all-time high of 8133. Thursday's session essentially placed the key U.S. indexes in a new intermediate-level correction. Volume increased sharply on both main exchanges, early data showed.

Dating app giant Match Group (MTCH) and a small group of enterprise software providers, including Adobe Systems (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW), rebounded mildly.

Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell more than 3% to $70.78 a barrel following reports of a third straight weekly jump in oil inventories in the U.S.

As President Donald Trump continued to criticize the Federal Reserve for raising the cost of money with its recent rate hikes, the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note fell sharply on Thursday, down 6 basis points to 3.17%. But it's still up from 3.09% on Oct. 1. The CME FedWatch tool still shows the probability of a fourth quarter-point jump in the Fed fund futures rate in December remaining near 80%.

Earnings From Delta Air Lines

Delta Air Lines (DAL) snapped a nine-day losing skid with a nearly 4% lift to 51.50. Volume jumped sharply above average. The stock had been working on the right side of a new base before shares began to collapse in price Sept. 24.

The international airline edged Wall Street estimates with a 17% rise in third-quarter earnings to $1.80 a share. Growth accelerated from a 4% pickup in Q1 and a 11% increase in Q2. Revenue rose 8% to $11.95 billion, close to its average increase of 8.5% in the prior four quarters.

Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura, noted that a 5.5% month-on-month gain in prices for airline passenger services helped push the unusually strong 0.4% rise in core U.S. producer prices.

""As this component has been volatile and is often affected by changes in jet fuel prices and the seasonal patterns of holiday travel, the 0.4% gain in the core PPI may not be sustainable,"" Alexander wrote in a note to clients.

The jump in inflation and signs that the Federal Reserve will not let up in raising the Fed funds rate (currently in a 2%-2.25% target range) have sparked the recent jump in short and long-term interest rates.

Watch for Q3 results from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), First Republic Bank (FRC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Friday.

A REIT Stock Joins The IBD 50

Vici Properties (VICI), which debuted on the NYSE on Feb. 1, fell nearly 3% to 20.63 and clipped its 50-day moving average for the first time in more than a month. The property REIT owns, acquires and develops gaming and hospitality-focused facilities.

The stock ranks No. 45 in the IBD 50 through Wednesday's close.

Revenue soared to $201 million in 2017 vs. $19 million the prior year. Wall Street sees earnings up more than 1,100% to $1.52 a share this year and up 12% in 2019.

Stock Market Slumps for Second Day as the Dow Drops Over 500 Points,"(Bloomberg) — U.S. stocks tumbled a second day, with major averages notching wild swings in heavy volume. Treasuries surged after a strong 30-year auction, the dollar fell with oil, and gold, that traditional safe haven, posted its biggest gain in more than two years.

The S&P 500 Index fell more than 2 percent for a second straight day and is now in its longest slide since 2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 500 points. Tech shares that bore the brunt of the selling Wednesday fared relatively better Thursday, though the Nasdaq 100 Index’s losses from an August record reached 8 percent.

“All of a sudden, you got that severe downturn because the results of the 30-year note auction were better than expected and people said ’We’re going to shift now,”’ said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities. “It was asset allocation, it was a plunge. That’s unusual. That’s not a normal rate of decline. That’s an accelerated rate of decline. It was an algorithm on the asset allocation because it took place after the bond auction which was better than expected.”

The S&P 500 is at a three-month low after a 6 percent slide in what’s the longest slump of Donald Trump’s presidency. Energy shares bore the brunt of selling after oil plunged by more than 3 percent. Financial firms also contributed heavily to the losses, with banks and insurers down at least 2.5 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 surrendered an earlier rally and added to its 4.4 percent decline on Wednesday. Trading was heavy with volume surging roughly 65 percent above average for this time over the past 30 days.

“This is just a normal run-of-the-mill correction that happens to be concentrated in some of the more expensive and most notable names in technology,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. “But I think it’s been precipitated by the uncertainty about global growth and whether or not Fed policy is going too far too fast.”

In addition to energy, insurers and household products manufacturers weighed on the market, while media companies and software makers were among the few bright spots. The Cboe Volatility Index rose to its highest level since February.

“Volatility is back and it may require more active strategies on the part of investors to pursue their long-term goals,” John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial, wrote in a note to clients Thursday. “Volatility is also not to be feared, but embraced, as varying data points will cause bouts of market anxiety. But remember that fundamentals are still strong.”

Earlier, Asian and European equities plunged as the market rout extended around the world. China’s Shanghai Composite gauge closed down more than 5 percent and Taiwan’s technology-heavy benchmark plummeted more than 6 percent. Europe’s main equity index fell to the lowest since December 2016. The euro and the pound both advanced.

Investors seeking to pinpoint the cause of the equities rout have no shortage of culprits to choose from. U.S companies are increasingly fretting the impact of the burgeoning trade war, while the same issue prompted the International Monetary Fund to dial down global growth expectations. And in the tech sector, which was a key driver of the rally that pushed American equities to a record just a month ago, expensive-looking companies have been roiled by a hacking scandal.

Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve has been trimming its balance sheet and raising interest rates, provoking Trump’s ire and helping to force a repricing of riskier assets.

"Dow tumbles over 500 points, bringing 2-day losses to more than 1,300 points","Stocks are getting slammed. Five experts weigh in on what to do now 11:33 AM ET Thu, 11 Oct 2018 | 04:57

Stocks fell sharply on Thursday in a second straight scary day on Wall Street as investors dumped equities around the globe because of fears of rapidly rising interest rates, a possible global economic slowdown and overly ambitious tech valuations.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 545.91 points lower at 25,052.83, bringing its two-day losses to more than 1,300 points. The S&P 500 dropped 2.1 percent to 2,728.37 and posted its sixth straight decline. The broad index also closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since April. The Nasdaq Composite pulled back 1.3 percent to 7,329.06 and briefly entered correction territory at its lows on Thursday.

The Dow fell as much as 698.97 points at its lows of the day. The indexes bounced after a report said President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would meet at next month's G-20 summit, briefly giving traders hope a full-blown trade war with the country could be avoided.

October, a month known for major market sell-offs in the past, has been a brutal month for investors so far. The S&P 500 has lost 6 percent during the month so far and is now higher by just 2 percent for 2018.

The financials sector was the second-worst performer on the S&P 500, dropping nearly 3 percent. J.P. Morgan Chase fell 3 percent, while Citigroup dropped 2.2 percent. Wells Fargo slipped 1.9 percent.

Treasury yields pulled back from multiyear highs, with the benchmark 10-year yield sliding to 3.13 percent. The two-year yield also fell to 2.84 percent. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) jumped 1.2 percent as investors clamored into bonds for safety.

The major indexes fell after some of the major tech names failed to recover from steep losses in the previous session. Netflix fell more than 1 percent after briefly trading higher. Apple also declined 0.9 percent, erasing earlier gains. Amazon dropped 2 percent after falling 6.2 percent on Wednesday.

""It's a momentum correction, not a portfolio correction,"" said Joe Terranova, chief market strategist at Virtus Investment Partners. ""While we have a bias to believe 2008 could happen again, I don't think this is the case.""

""Less is more in this environment,"" Terranova added. ""I think you need to be an observer of the guidance you get in earnings."""

Wall Street had another rough day on Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index dipping into correction territory and the Dow Jones closing 548 points down after another day of market convulsions.

Following a rocky morning of premarket trading, the major exchanges had pared their losses by midday and looked set to regain their footing. However, by mid-afternoon, the sell-off had intensified: All 11 sectors of the S&P were trading lower, the Dow had plunged by 699 points, and the CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" hit its highest level since February.

As investors fled the stock market for bonds and other safer assets, gold surged by 3 percent to hit its highest level since early August.

Energy and financials bore the brunt of Thursday's sell-off; oil fell to a two-week low after a report indicated inventory in the U.S. was higher than anticipated. Insurers also suffered losses as Hurricane Michael ravaged Florida and the Carolinas.

The market rebounded slightly after news broke that China's President Xi Jinping would likely meet with President Donald Trump at the G20 summit in Argentina next month. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow confirmed to reporters on Thursday that a meeting was under discussion.

Thursday's market mayhem followed a global ricochet triggered the previous day when the Dow Jones tumbled by more than 800 points to its lowest level since February as investors responded to rising rates, trade tensions and a huge tech sell-off."

The Dow plunged 500 points on Thursday, exacerbating a 800-point drop the day before that marked the blue-chip average's largest rout since February.

Investors remain on edge over tariff concerns and a recent jump in interest rates. President Donald Trump added fuel to the fire by castigating the Federal Reserve for continuing to hike a benchmark rate that affects both business and consumer loans.

The Dow Jones industrial average slid 546 points, or 2.13 percent, to close at 25,052.83. The index also fell below its average price over the past 200 days, a widely watched level that can provide support during sell-offs.

""This is another bad day,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. ""One of the discouraging things is the market really tried to rally during the day and it couldn’t hold on to it.""

A market correction – a decline of 10 percent or more from a peak – isn't out of the question, said Brian Levitt, senior investment strategist at Oppenheimer Funds. But corrections occur almost every year and one now is unlikely to mean the end of the bull market. The Dow currently is 6.6 percent off its peak from Oct. 3.

""Volatility is the ticket to the game,"" said Levitt. ""Investors should have a plan, stick to it, invest in the long term and don't worry about bursts of volatility. It happens.""

Still, Wall Street pros are debating whether the current slide is signaling more severe problems for a bull market that is more than nine years old. Here's what they're watching:

Bonds, gold

Are investors running for so-called safer investments? By Thursday's measure, the answer is yes. Gold prices recorded their largest gain in over two years, while Treasuries jumped after a better-than-expected auction of 30-year notes.

Other indexes

The Standard & Poor's 500, the large-company stock index, closed at 2,728.37 on Thursday, below its long-term trend line, or average price over the past 200 trading days. If the index consistently falls below its so-called 200-day moving average of 2,766, that could be a negative sign for the market. The S&P 500 is also down 6.9 percent from its record high.

The Russell 2000, an index of small-company stocks, also fell into official correction territory after sliding nearly 2 percent in Thursday’s rout. The index is now 11.2 percent below its August 31 record high.

What are tech stocks doing?

Tech stocks, the longtime market leaders, have suffered in the latest rout as Chinese tariffs, and recent security concerns have put these companies in the spotlight. The Nasdaq composite, which is packed with tech stocks, performed better than both the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500 on Thursday, but is still 9.6 percent from its all-time high in late August. Amazon ended Thursday down 2.04 percent; Apple was 0.88 percent lower; Netflix lost 1.47 percent; and Google declined 0.18 percent. Facebook ended higher.

Investors also got some good news on the economy early Thursday. An inflation reading on U.S. consumer prices in September came in lower than expected at 0.1 percent, which suggested that inflationary pressures are not ramping up.

The economy, too, remains healthy despite the volatility.

""Is this the big one? Is it 2008? I think the better comparison is where we were at the end of January,"" said McMillan of Commonwealth Financial Network.

""Markets got ahead of themselves and had to readjust,"" he continued, ""but the economic fundamentals are solid.""
