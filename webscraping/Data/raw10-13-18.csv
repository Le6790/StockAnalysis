2 Great Stocks That Just Went on Sale -- The Motley Fool,"The stock market just had a significant pullback, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging by more than 1,300 points over a two-day stretch.

However, market moves like this aren't a reason to panic. Instead, think about stock market corrections in the same way you would think about a sale at your favorite store -- as a great time to buy quality merchandise at lower prices. With that in mind, here are two stocks that have been beaten down recently that are on the top of my shopping list right now.

A growing financial ecosystem

Fintech company Square's (NYSE:SQ) stock took quite a beating yesterday -- down nearly 30% from its recent highs, and that's after a bit of a rebound.

Fortunately, the move isn't due to anything that affects the company's long-term growth potential. In fact, there have been three major negative catalysts driving Square's stock price downward:

Square announced that it was tiptoeing into consumer lending with Square Installments. To be clear, this adds long-term growth potential, but it also adds an additional element of credit risk, which is likely the reason the market reacted negatively. Square's CEO Jack Dorsey recently sold more than 103,000 shares of the stock. Simply put, this is a complete nonevent from a long-term perspective. This was a planned sale that resulted from Dorsey's exercise of stock options -- that's all. Square's CFO Sarah Friar has decided to leave the company to pursue other opportunities. Now, Friar has been an absolute rock star in her role, and there's certainly value in having great managers. So I'm really not surprised this caused a downward move. I'm certainly curious to see who the next CFO will be, but I have no reason to doubt the ability of Dorsey and his team to find the right person for the job.

Here's the bottom line: Square has amazing long-term growth potential with several different aspects of its business. Has this changed? Not at all.

A massive consumer banking growth opportunity

I've had my eye on Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) for quite some time, and this latest downward move might finally get me to pull the trigger and add it to my portfolio. As of this writing, Goldman is down more than 13% from its recent high.

For starters, although it trades for one of the lowest price-to-book valuations in the entire financial sector, Goldman's recent results have been quite impressive. Investment banking continues to grow, wealth management assets have increased consistently, and profitability has been strong.

However, the reason I'm most excited about Goldman Sachs as a long-term investment is for its largely untapped opportunity in consumer banking. If you aren't familiar, Goldman has charged into consumer banking with its Marcus by Goldman Sachs platform, which has made billions in personal loans and offers high-yield online savings accounts. While the early results have been great, both sides of the business are still quite small by ""big bank"" standards.

This could just be the tip of the iceberg. We recently learned that Goldman is getting into the credit card business as Apple's co-branding partner. And in a presentation a few months ago, Goldman's then-president and COO David Solomon mentioned several other potential areas of growth, such as mortgages, auto loans, insurance products, checking accounts, and payment solutions.

Here's why I think Goldman will become a major force in consumer banking. The bank has the resources of a large-scale bank to grow its offerings as aggressively or as cautiously as it wants, and it has one of the most recognizable brand names in the financial world. And because it doesn't operate commercial banking branches, it has a major cost advantage over any banks of comparable size.

In a nutshell, Goldman Sachs has all of the advantages of a big bank but without the hinderance of a legacy branch network.

Short-term weakness in long-term winners

Are Square and Goldman Sachs worth 30% and 13% less, respectively, than they were just a few weeks ago? Of course not. These two companies both have just as much growth potential as they did prior to the recent market drop, and in many ways, they looked cheap even before the plunge. If these two stocks aren't on your radar yet, maybe they should be now."
DowDuPont Takes Over as Dow's Poorest Performer (NYSE: DWDP),"DowDuPont Inc. (NYSE: DWDP) saw its share price dive last week, along with just about every other equity on the market — or so it seemed. The company’s shares dropped 5.6% last week to take the stock down by 16.2% for the year to date.

The second-worst Dow stock so far this year is Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS), which is down 16.1%. That is followed by 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM), down 15.8%, Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG), down 14%, and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), down 9.8%. Of the 30 Dow stocks, 14 trade lower so far in 2018.

The blue-chip index dropped 1,107 points last week to close at 23,339.99, down 4.2% compared to the previous Friday’s close. For the year to date, the index is up 2.1%, trailing both the S&P 500 (up 2.6%) and the Nasdaq Composite (up 7.0%).

On Thursday the company declared its quarterly dividend payment of $0.38 per share payable December 14 to shareholders of record on November 30. The industrial giant’s dividend yield at Friday’s close is 2.58%.

The materials sector dropped 6.6% last week and trades down about 11% for the year to date. The chemicals industry, which includes DowDuPont, dropped 6.3% last week and is down 7.4% for the year to date. And the chemicals industry is the best performer in the materials sector.

The company also revealed the new logo for what will become the new DuPont sometime next year when DowDuPont carves itself into three publicly traded companies. The specialty products division of DowDuPont will be renamed DuPont and will sport the new logo, a close variant of DuPont’s iconic oval.

DowDuPont’s stock closed at $59.66 on Friday, up about 1.2% for the day, in a 52-week range of $58.81 to $77.08. The 12-month consensus price target on the stock is $80.59 and the forward price-to-earnings ratio is 12.35."
Many Americans Don't Understand These Basic Financial Terms -- The Motley Fool,"Let's face it: Financial talk can be confusing at times. With so much jargon, it can seem like a foreign language. It's an important language to understand, though, because if you fail to understand certain basic concepts, you may put your financial health at risk.

A significant portion of Americans are not confident in their understanding of basic financial terms, according to a survey from polling firm YouGov and training organization TheKnowledgeAcademy. This makes it more difficult to plan for retirement and set yourself up for financial security, because when you don't fully understand these terms, it's harder to make smart financial decisions.

Researchers found that one of the most commonly misunderstood financial terms was ""index fund,"" with 49% of participants saying they didn't have a strong grasp on what the term means. Other commonly confused terms included ""asset allocation,"" ""Roth IRA,"" and ""mutual fund.""

That's bad news, because each of those things may play a pivotal role in the best saving and investing plan for you.

Studying doesn't end with school

Studying financial lingo can give you a leg up as you're preparing for retirement, because the better you understand these terms, the better equipped you'll be to serve your own best interests.

Index funds

Indexes are essentially large groups of investments that are assembled based on various criteria. The S&P 500, for instance, is one of the most popular indexes, and it includes a broad array of stocks that are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, based on market capitalization (which is the market value of a company's outstanding shares). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (aka the Dow) is another popular index, and it tracks 30 stocks that, in theory, provide a general representation of the U.S. economy.

An index fund, then, is a portfolio that is designed to replicate a certain index. So if you're investing in an index fund that tracks the Dow, that fund would be expected to have all 30 stocks that are in the Dow in roughly the same proportions.

The biggest advantage of index funds is that they're passive investments, meaning they don't require a lot of effort by managers to maintain them. In turn, you pay less in fees. The average expense ratio (which is essentially the annual fee you pay for your investments) for passive funds was 0.17% in 2017, according to a report from Morningstar, compared to a 0.52% average among mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Index funds also take the guesswork out of choosing stocks for your portfolio, because instead of picking individual stocks, you can simply choose an index and invest in all the stocks it contains at once.

In general, index funds that track the broader stock market have proven to be successful over time. After all, the S&P 500 has a long-term average return of around 10%. That doesn't mean it's immune to downturns (it lost 38% in 2008 alone, for example), but over time, the stock market's returns have far outpaced the returns of other traditional investments.

Mutual funds

A mutual fund is essentially a pool of investments, and it allows you to invest in many different stocks, bonds, and other types of securities at once. A mutual fund can be an index fund, but typically, mutual funds are overseen by a portfolio manager who decides where to invest your money in (whereas index funds are passively managed). That also means that they tend to be more expensive than index funds. The analysts who are hard at work picking investments need to make a living, after all.

Mutual funds can consist of a mixture of stocks, bonds, and other securities depending on your tolerance for risk, so you can choose a highly customized portfolio that fits your needs. However, most of the time, these actively managed investments tend to underperform passive investments (like index funds). During 2017 and 2018, for example, only 36% of active managers' portfolios outperformed similar passive investments, according to research from Morningstar -- meaning that paying for someone to manage your funds may not pay off in the form of greater returns.

That doesn't mean, though, that mutual funds aren't right for you. With the right manager, actively managed mutual funds have the ability to greatly outperform the market. You also don't need to choose just one or the other; by investing in both index funds and actively managed mutual funds, you can diversify your portfolio.

Asset allocation

You've heard that you should never put all your eggs in one basket, and asset allocation is essentially the same principle. Because the stock market can be unpredictable and you never really know which investments will skyrocket or plummet, it's important to diversify your portfolio by putting your money in a variety of different investments.

The types of investments in your portfolio should range from very safe (Treasury notes and bills, for example) to relatively risky (stocks). The safer investments will typically have lower returns, but they're less likely to lose much of their value in the event of a financial meltdown. The riskier investments, meanwhile, usually have higher returns over the long run, which will help your funds grow faster.

Exactly how much money you put into these asset categories will depend on your tolerance for risk. If you're nearing retirement (or have already retired), you'll typically want to lean toward the conservative side -- but not too conservative, because you still want your investments to grow during retirement. If you're young and still have a few decades before you need that money, you can afford to go riskier. After all, even if the stock market takes a considerable dip, you'll have time to recoup your investments by the time you need them.

If you're not comfortable with risk at all, you may assume that it's best to stick to only the most reliable investments (like Treasury notes and bills) and avoid stocks. However, even if you start saving early in life, those types of investments may not yield the returns you need to live a comfortable retirement.

For example, say right now you have a conservative portfolio with mostly Treasury notes, bills, and bonds, with a few stocks mixed in, and you're earning an annual rate of return of 2%. If you're investing, say, $1,000 per year, you'll end up with roughly $40,000 after 30 years. If you allocate more of your money to stocks, though, and earn an annual return of, say, 8%, you'll have around $120,000 after 30 years. So while you shouldn't invest your life savings in that new tech stock you think is ready to skyrocket in value, you'll need to be at least somewhat comfortable with risk if you want your investments to grow enough to last you through retirement.

Roth IRA: When it comes to choosing a retirement account, one of your options is a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows you to set aside income for retirement, much like a 401(k). The money you contribute is subject to income tax, but you won't pay taxes on the funds you withdraw in retirement. As you plan for retirement, you know that the amount you have in your Roth IRA is the amount you'll be able to spend when you withdraw it, because income taxes are taken out of the equation. With other types of retirement funds (such as traditional 401(k)s and IRAs), your initial contributions are tax-deductible, but you'll owe income tax on the amount you withdraw.

Another perk Roth IRAs offer is increased flexibility when it comes to withdrawals. With traditional IRAs, if you withdraw any money from your account before age 59 1/2, you'll pay a 10% penalty on the distributed amount (in addition to the income tax). With Roth IRAs, however, you can withdraw any of your original contributions (but not your investment gains) at any time, penalty-free. That said, keep in mind that it's not a good idea to withdraw retirement savings early unless it's absolutely necessary.

While not having to pay taxes on your Roth IRA withdrawals is an advantage, it can potentially be a downside if you have a lower income when you retire than when you initially made your contributions. You're paying taxes up front, so if you're in a higher tax bracket during your earlier working years than you are when you retire, you could end up paying more in taxes than you would with a traditional IRA.

Financial jargon can sometimes make your head spin, but it's important to understand some of the fundamental terms if you want to be a savvy investor. Do your homework, and you'll be setting yourself up for financial success -- and a more enjoyable retirement."
Dana Milbank: The economy is crushing it — just like in 2008!,"After the Dow Jones industrials plunged 832 points on Wednesday, Larry Kudlow, President Trump's chief economic adviser, walked up the White House driveway and proclaimed that there was no cause for concern. Not about the stock market, or turmoil in China's economy, or American casualties of Trump's trade fights, or the president's attempt to bully the Federal Reserve into an easy-money stance.

""Our economy and the people and the workers and entrepreneurs, they're killing it. We're the hottest in the world,"" Kudlow proclaimed in front of the CNBC camera. ""We're crushing it right now, and I think that's going to continue regardless of China.""

Kudlow, standing outside the West Wing, offered versions of this happy talk — “I don’t think this is anything resembling a sugar high ... America is on a tear” — to any other reporter who would listen.

But the Pollyanna performance didn't play well on Wall Street. The Dow lost another 546 points Thursday. The index had a partial recovery Friday but finished the week down 4.2 percent, the third straight weekly decline.

Maybe that's because investors had heard Kudlow say such words once before.

Ten months before the crash of 2008: ""There's no recession coming.""

Seven months before the crash: ""The economy will be rebounding sometime this summer, if not sooner.""

Six weeks before the crash: ""An awful lot of very good new news.""

Markets rise and markets fall, and this last week's volatility doesn't necessarily mean the economy will tank. But it does show the limits of Trump's hucksterism.

Though Trump called the stock market a “bubble” during the campaign, he has boasted scores of times about new records it has set during his presidency. On Saturday, he told a crowd: “Your 401(k)s, you all look like a bunch of geniuses — thank you, Donald, very much.” So far, that has worked, because economic growth has continued under Trump, and indeed accelerated after the massive stimulus of a tax cut and spending increase. Republicans would otherwise be facing bigger losses in next month’s midterms.

But now come scattered signs of trouble. The Fed has been raising interest rates — in part because Trump’s massive stimulus during an expansion threatens to set off inflation. China’s economy has been unstable, in part because of Trump’s trade dispute.

Article continues below

And though the trade deficit with China hit a record in September, Trump's tariffs have hurt many U.S. producers; Ford, claiming the tariffs cost it $1 billion, is planning workforce cuts.

No amount of fact-checker Pinocchios will stop his followers from accepting Trump’s word that Robert S. Mueller III is on a witch hunt, global warming is a hoax, North Korea no longer is a nuclear threat and Democrats are a dangerous mob. But they can feel the economy personally. When the downturn comes, huge deficits, which Trump widened, will leave the federal government with little power to cushion the fall. If this happens on his watch, even Trump’s ardent supporters would see it’s not fake news — and that would be the end of him.

Trump needs reassurance — and Kudlow, the former TV business pundit, now plays the carnival barker’s carnival barker.

With cameras in the room for a prescription-drug bill signing Wednesday, Trump introduced ""the great Larry Kudlow, whose voice is so beautiful. ... The economy, Larry, how is it doing?""

""Couldn't be better,"" replied Kudlow.

And Kudlow's message couldn't be otherwise:

Oct. 7: ""Right now, the American economy is crushing it.""

Sept. 28: ""We're crushing it, we're absolutely crushing it.""

Sept. 17: ""We're crushing it.""

Sept. 6: ""We're crushing it.""

Aug. 28: ""America today is just crushing it everywhere.""

Aug. 17: ""We are crushing it. And people say this is not sustainable, it's a one-quarter blip? It's just nonsense.""

In Thursday’s interview, Jim Cramer, Kudlow’s former partner on CNBC, tried to temper Kudlow’s mania. Cramer cautioned about a slowdown in business in key economic sectors, a peak in real estate, slower lending, declining demand for luxury goods — “a pastiche that I’m concerned about.”

Kudlow brushed off the worries. ""I'm just saying there's so much good news out there that we shouldn't just try to find a couple of numbers that don't look great, okay?"" he said. ""This is a heck of a story. Let's embrace it.""

Sound familiar? ""The Bush boom is alive and well,"" Kudlow said before the 2008 crash, calling the soon-to-collapse economy ""still the greatest story.""

Until it wasn't.

Cryptocurrencies Take a Beating as Stocks Slump With Rising US–China Tensions,"Advertisement

The stock markets are going through carnage on both sides of the Atlantic. Tensions between the US and China and concerns over a full-blown trade war between them are making central banks take precautionary measures. Now equities do not have a stimulus to keep pushing prices higher. The impact is a slump in global stock prices. And the cryptocurrency sector is likewise affected because of these issues. The top 10 cryptos were in the red, along with the S&P and Dow Jones, on Thursday, Oct. 11.

Trump Blames Fed for Interest Rate

President Donald Trump is usually quick to remark on internal matters and foreign powers. The US Federal Reserve has seen the economy growing steadily with some signs of inflation. This led to the country’s central bank increasing interest rates. Some more hikes are expected in the upcoming quarters to keep the economy in check. As markets declined on the news, Trump quickly blamed the Fed, calling the rate hike a “mistake.” He said, “It’s so tight, I think the Fed has gone crazy,” adding that the institution is “going loco.”

Global stock markets followed the Dow Jones on Thursday as both emerging, and developed economies faced the fears of an imminent trade war between the US and China. Stock markets rebounded in the US and Europe on Friday, October 12.

Why Did Cryptos Decline?

The reason behind the crypto slump is unclear. According to some experts, the decline happened because of investors’ general risk aversion. They would not like to invest in something as volatile as digital currencies in testing economic times. Some analysts also suggest that the price slump happened because the price of Bitcoin has fallen below the total cost of electricity to mine it. This led to a 4% decline in Bitcoin, while Ethereum and XRP lowered their prices by more than 10%. Prices have recovered somewhat since the decline.

A continued risk in equities and cryptocurrencies is expected next week due to a lack of liquidity for cryptocurrencies and the growing tensions between the US and China. According to Kit Juckes, global fixed-income strategist at Societe Generale, Trump could label China a currency manipulator in the upcoming week, which could create more troubles in the market. Juckes commented that the US has been impervious to indications that the world economy is beginning to slow, and the broader markets believe that the US Fed “will soften its tone” if the sell-off continues."
"Rising Rates, Trade War Continue Taking Toll on Stocks","Stocks moved sharply lower last week after 10-year Treasury yields reached 3.25% mid-week. Rising interest rates tend to draw capital from equities to bonds, and these trends are reinforced by a flight to safety. Investors are increasingly seeking out safe-haven assets that offer more attractive yields while locking in their multi-year gains on equities.

These trends could continue to play out over the coming weeks as investors reassess their portfolios. Corporate earnings were strong during the first three quarters of the year, but they're expected to slow down next year as the impact of tax cuts fades and wages begin to rise. The trade war could further increase material costs for many industries and businesses.

Next week, traders will be watching several key economic indicators, including industrial production on Oct. 16, jobless claims on Oct. 18 and existing home sales on Oct. 19. The market will also be keeping a close eye on the evolving Sino-U.S. trade war that could spark wider losses.

S&P 500 Losses Continue to Mount

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) fell 3.86% last week and has dropped more than 5% over the past month. After breaking down from trendline support, the index broke through all key support levels to trendline support at around $272.00. Traders should watch for a rebound from these levels to retest S2 resistance at $281.98 or a breakdown to test prior lows at around $260.00. Looking at technical indicators, the relative strength index (RSI) appears oversold at 29.38, but the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) remains in a sharp downward spiral.

Industrials Fall Sharply Lower

The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) fell 3.77% last week. After breaking below trendline support, the index fell to the 200-day moving average at $249.44 before finding its footing. Traders should watch for some consolidation above these levels and a potential move to the 50-day moving average and S1 resistance at around $259.00 or a breakdown from trendline support to retest prior lows at around $240.00. The RSI appears oversold at 34.55, but the MACD remains in a bearish downtrend.

Tech Stocks See Modest Losses

The PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 2.8% last week. After breaking through trendline support to trendline support at around $168.00, the index recovered some ground by the end of last week. Traders should watch for a move to retest S2 resistance at $177.76 or a breakdown from trendline support to prior lows of around $160.00. Looking at technical indicators, the RSI appears oversold at 36.74, but the MACD remains in a strong bearish downtrend.

Small Caps Continue to Plummet

The iShares Russell 2000 Index (IWM) fell 5.04% last week and has declined more than 10% over the past month. After breaking down from trendline support earlier this month, the index continued its march lower last week to hit prior lows of around $152.00. Traders should watch for a rebound from these levels toward the 200-day moving average at $160.19 or a breakdown from $152.00 support levels to fresh lows. The RSI appears very oversold at 16.95, but the MACD remains in a long bearish downtrend.

"Stock Market Experts Say Recent Downturn Is A Stumble, Not A Plunge","



Whoa, what was that?

After months of relative calm, Wall Street has been jolted by a sudden run of turbulent trading.

The swoon wiped more than 1,300 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average over two days and dragged the benchmark S&P 500 index down more than 5 percent. The VIX index, which measures how worried traders are about a decline in stocks, climbed Thursday to its highest level since February, when the S&P last had a correction, or a 10 percent drop.

What now?

Experts say this new eruption of market volatility should not be surprising, especially after the long stretch of relative calm investors have enjoyed.

Over the summer, traders set aside worries about the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute and instead focused on more encouraging developments: solid economic growth and record corporate earnings. It helped that stocks were on the rise — the S&P 500 hit an all-time high just four weeks ago.

So after several months of gains, a pullback would be expected, said John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Research.

“Volatility is back and it may require more active strategies on the part of investors to pursue their long-term goals,” Lynch said. “Volatility is also not to be feared, but embraced, as varying data points will cause bouts of market anxiety. But remember that fundamentals are still strong.”

The economy is indeed quite strong by many measures — consumer spending is growing, unemployment is low and manufacturing surveys are near record levels. And many experts say that is more important than the market’s daily ups and downs.

So what’s behind this week’s upset?

Investors have grown concerned about a recent, steep drop in U.S. government bond prices and an ensuing upward move in bond yields, which makes bonds more attractive relative to stocks. The market is also worried about rising interest rates, which tend to climb on expectations of future economic growth and inflation and can increase costs for business — slowing growth and dampening corporate profits.

“There’s some concern that third-quarter earnings could be maybe a little bit less robust than they were in the second quarter and there could be more pressure on profit margins,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird.

Worries about a slowdown in the global economy and the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute also have contributed to investors’ unease. And markets typically see increased volatility in months preceding midterm elections.

“We are not surprised by the uptick in volatility toward more normal levels,” market strategists at Wells Fargo Investment Institute wrote in a report Thursday, adding that “it’s too soon to say that the pullback is over.”

Having bonds and equities selling off may feel like the worst of both worlds for investment portfolios, but the market’s shift isn’t as bad as it might seem, said Michael Crook, head of institutional strategy at UBS Global Wealth Management.

He notes that the S&P 500 is basically back to where it was during the summer, and only down slightly from its all-time high. In addition, the negative return in bonds barely registers when one considers how bonds have performed this year.

“That’s very normal volatility, and while it has been acute — like all market drops — it only erases a few weeks of gains,” Crook said.

The market’s stability in 2017 may have given investors a false sense of security too, said Nationwide Chief of Investment Research Mark Hackett. The fundamental strength of that year resulted in historically low volatility and market pullbacks.

One natural reaction to increased volatility is the inclination to get off the wild ride and sell. If you have a lengthy time horizon for the investment, say a decade, the general recommendation is to resist that temptation. Stocks have historically offered some of the biggest returns over the long term for investors.

For investors who want less volatility, bonds, savings accounts or other investments offer less risk. The trade-off is that returns over the coming decade will likely be lower.

Remember that what is happening in the headlines is not necessarily what is happening in your portfolio, said Judith Ward, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price.

Still feeling jumpy? Review your portfolio and make sure your holdings are where you want them to be and that they’re on course to meet your goals. Rebalance the portfolio, if needed, but resist the urge to flee.

Any financial adviser will remind you that those who sold in the depths of the global financial meltdown missed out on big gains in years that followed.
