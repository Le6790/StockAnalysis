The main US indexes dropped in another black session on Wall Street,"Share This On Social

The main US indexes ended the last trading session of the week with a significant drop, as investors went through another volatile session on Wall Street.

The blue-chip index Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session with a fall of 296.24 points and reached a level of 24,688.31 points, after wiping out 539 points earlier during the session. The technology index Nasdaq Composite dropped by 2.34% to 6,852.40 points. The broader S&P 500 wiped out 1.73% to a level of 2,658.69 points after briefly entering the correction phase and trading more than 13% below its 52-week high. The average post-World War II stock market correction means a decrease of 13% and lasts four months before becoming a bear market.

Seven of the 11 sectors included in the S&P 500 have dropped at least by 10% from their 52-week peak, including energy, commodity and finance. About 75% of the companies in the index also entered a correction phase.

Among the driving forces behind the sharp decrease in the market on Friday were the disappointing reports of key technology companies, which worsen the strong figures for the US economy.

The stocks of Amazon declined by 7.8% after the company released its third quarter report on Thursday. At the same time, Alphabet wiped out 5.6% of its market capitalization earlier in the day, but closed the session down 1.8%. The profit of both companies exceeded the expectations of analysts, but their earnings did not justify the forecasts, which cause decline in stocks prices.

The falls were sufficient to offset the better-than-expected figures for the growth of the US economy. The Department of Trade reported that the economy grew by 3.5% in the third quarter, which is slightly above the expectations of 3.4%. In addition, the Personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE), which is a key measure of inflation, rose by 1.6% in the last quarter.

The markets have suffered in recent weeks, as fears of rising inflation and rising interest rates have curbed expectations of corporate profits. The PCE index is the preferred measure of inflation by the Federal Reserve, so a sign of its slowdown may frustrate the central bank’s plan to continue raising interest rates.

Consumer spending, accounting for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose by by 4% in the third quarter, which is the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014.

The major US indexes record serious losses for the week. This week, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones dropped by 3.9% and 3% respectively. The technology index Nasdaq Composite ended with a decline of 3.8%. For October, Dow Jones and S&P 500 wiped out 6.7% and 8.8% respectively, while Nasdaq lost 10.9%.

A number of factors contributed to the sharp decline in stock markets and main indexes this month – some disappointing corporate reports, fears of rising interest rates, the emerging conflict between Italy and the European Union over budget spending, criticism of Saudi Arabia after the murder of a dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as well as the slowing growth of the world economy.

On the bond markets, the yields on 10-year US government securities declined to 3.079% and yields on 30-year US government securities declined to 3.315%.

Crude oil prices rose during the session, backed by expectations that sanctions on Iran would reduce supply. However, the futures on crude oil declined for a third consecutive week, as stock market slump and trade war concerns dampened prospects for demand of fuels.

The US light crude oil WTI ended Friday’s session with growth of 0.26 USD to 67.58 USD per barrel, but it dropped by 2.2% during the week. The contracts rose in four of the five sessions this week, but that was not enough to offset the decline of nearly 3 USD on Tuesday.

At the same time, the price of Brent oil rose by 0.72 USD to 77.61 USD per barrel after it dropped by more than a dollar earlier in the day. The brent oil contracts are going to record a weekly loss of nearly 3%. The Brent’s price has fallen by more than 10 USD over the past three weeks.

The price of gold reached its highest level for over three months, as investors focused on asset-backed assets amid a sharp decline in global stock markets. The metal is about to record a fourth consecutive weekly increase. The US futures on gold increased by 3.40 USD to value of 1,235.80 USD per ounce."
More Bearish Sentiment Will Create Buying Opportunities,"Last week's selling was relentless, with every rally failing quickly, followed by selling. Even the 1.8% gain in the S&P 500 last Thursday was not enough to stimulate more buying, and it dropped back 1.7% on Friday. Worst-hit was the Dow Jones Transportation Average, losing 4.53% for the week.

The S&P 500 did not do much better last week, as it was down 3.94%, just slightly worse than the 3.59% drop in the Nasdaq 100, as several of the tech giants were hit with heavy selling after they reported earnings.

As the table indicates, even the Dow Jones Utilities lost 2.22% for the week, and is now just barely higher for the year. The Utilities Sector Select (XLU) currently has a yield of 3.4%, well above the yield on the 10-Year T-Note. Only the Nasdaq 100 is showing a decent YTD gain of 7.13%, in spite of the fact that it is down over 10% this month.

The charts of the two key Dow averages, Industrials and Transportation, look quite interesting right now. The Dow Jones Industrials peaked on October 2 at 26,951, and with Friday’s low of 24,445, has dropped 9.2% from the all-time high. The weekly chart shows that the next strong support is from early February, at 23,533 (line a). This is 4.4% below Friday’s close.

The Dow Jones Transportation Index peaked on September 14 at 11,623, and with Friday’s low of 9,819, was down 15.5% from the all-time high. Last week's low was just barely above the February low of 9,806.79. There is even stronger support from November 2017 at 9,409. The 200-day MA is now at 10,785, which is now resistance.

So far in the October, the S&P 500 is down 255 points (-8.7%), but the month is not over yet. The monthly chart of the S&P 500 shows that it is still above the rising 20-month EMA at 2621. Despite the severity of this performance, historically, this does not make the list of the Top Five worst monthly performances in the S&P 500.

That award goes to Oct. 1987 (1987-10), when the S&P was down 21.78%. The chart goes back to 1998 when the S&P 500 was down 14.58% in August. The current situation looks the most like 1998, when the S&P eventually rebounded to make new highs by the end of the year. In October 2008, during the last bear market, the S&P lost 16.94%. The declines in 1973 and 1974 occurred after the stock market had already completed a bull market top.

According to the latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), investors are getting more nervous, but still, 28% are bullish, down 6 points for the week. The bearish% has risen to 41%, also a change of 6 points. Long term readers may remember that the bullish% has frequently been significantly lower at major corrections lows.

As I commented in February 2016 two days after the market low: “According to AAII the bullis% dropped 8.3% in the latest survey to 19.2% bullish just above the 17.9% reading from mid-January. [...] [T]his reading was the lowest since 2005 and last week's reading is just slightly more bullish than the 18.9% reading on March 5, 2009 as the bear market was ending.”

Even though investor sentiment seems to be showing some fear, a recent Yahoo article pointed out that according to Bank of America, $8.5 billion moved into global equity funds over the past week. It was quite surprising that $2.6 billion moved into the emerging market funds, as one of the larger emerging market ETFs, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), is down 8.3% YTD.

Despite the two-week plunge and the fact that the S&P 500 has closed 9.28% below the record close, most on Wall Street are still bullish. Their positive outlook for the stock market is based on the continued strength of the economic data and the positive corporate earnings.

Though I would agree that there are no signs that the economy is ready to top out and that a recession is not currently on the horizon, I think more negative sentiment is needed before the stock market can bottom. A further increase in the fear level could help the stock market complete a bottom.

After a long overdue rebound it will probably take another wave of selling that could be triggered by a weaker-than-expected economic data point. The yield on the 10 –Year T-Note topped out on October 15 when its MACD turned negative (line c). Yields briefly moved back above the 3.20% level but closed last week at 3.077%. A decline to the 2.95-3.02% area (line a) now looks likely.

The preliminary 3rd quarter GDP was stronger than expected, at 3.5%, thanks to strong consumer spending. Also on Friday, the Consumer Sentiment held firm at 98.6 only down slightly from the prior reading of 99. I am watching the consumer data closely for signs that their mood is changing. Consumer Confidence is out on Tuesday after hitting an eighteen-year high in September. The chart shows a solid uptrend (line a) with no signs of a top.

The Chicago PMI is out on Wednesday, followed by the ISM Manufacturing Index on Thursday, and the monthly jobs report on Friday. Maybe a weaker-than-expected job report will create some doubts about the health of the economy. A Democratic takeover of the U.S. House could trigger a final wave of selling.

The 1.86% gain in the Spyder Trust (SPY) is barely visible on the daily chart, as it was followed by 1.73% drop-off on Friday. The late-June lows have been broken with the next strong level of support at $256.59 and the early May lows. This level is 3.3% below Friday’s close. There is initial resistance at $270 with the 20-day EMA at $277.34.

The daily S&P 500 Advance/Decline dropped below its WMA at the start of the month, and then violated support (line c). Since then, it has stayed well below its declining WMA, and shows no signs yet of bottoming. The A/D line is holding well above its June low (line d) and is acting stronger than prices, which is a positive sign for the intermediate term.

The weekly S&P 500 A/D line dropped below its WMA on October 12, and last week, the Dow A/D line also dropped below its WMA. All of the weekly A/D lines, except for the Russell 2000, made new highs with the averages in September. This is not consistent with a major top.

The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) had a low last week of $164.23 which was just above the 61.8% support from the February low of $149.84. There is a further band of support in the $158.50-$160 area with the April low at $152.55. Initial resistance is in the $170 area with the declining 20-day EMA at $174.66.

The weekly Nasdaq 100 A/D line dropped below its WMA the week of October 12 and has next major support at the June low (line b). The A/D line is holding up better than QQQ which has already violated its corresponding low. The volume has been very heavy for the past three weeks, as there has been some panic liquidation in the large cap stocks which have been the volume leaders.

Many of these large cap stocks are approaching major support, where they are likely to bottom out. Investors should ride out this correction, as the major averages are likely to make new highs by early 2019. Those who are uncomfortable with the high level of volatility could consider reducing their equity exposure on the expected rally.

Here’s what you get when you stick a bunch of investing wonks on an island,"The event: Stocktoberfest West. The host: StockTwits. The location: I can see Mexico from my balcony! The topic: Markets and lots of other stuff.

Maybe it was all that Coronado sun, or perhaps it was the open bar talking, but a cynical gathering of journalists and Wall Street grumblers this was not. In fact, the mood at the event was rather festive, especially considering the recent news flow.

StockTwits CEO Ian Rosen, a former MarketWatch general manager, hailed Stocktoberfest as his “favorite day of the year,” and he got the fun started with a brief introduction. From there, the parade of speakers included investors, entrepreneurs and Finance Twitter types, broken up into easily digestible 20- to 30-minute chunks.

For those who missed it ...

... here are just some of the highlights:

Cash is king

Mark Dow of the Behavioral Macro blog said his trading account is flush with cash, and this recent rough patch in the markets feels altogether different from the last the last time markets felt such intense selling pressure. “We’re seeing even companies that have good earnings getting hit,” Dow said, referring to the selling Amazon AMZN, +0.99% and Alphabet GOOG, +0.56% GOOGL, +1.38% endured after they reported this week. “When that happens, you know something is up. I think it’s because the expansion has gone on so long,” he said. “There’s been damage to investors’ psyche and the buy-the-dip mentality.”

Howard’s trend

Coronado local and StockTwits founder Howard Lindzon said he’s “high cash,” as well, explaining he gets all the risk he needs in the early-stage investing game. Lindzon did, however, offer some tips for those combing the public markets. “I’m looking at the 100 highest relative-strength stocks and riding trends as long as I can. ... Basically, a price-momentum model,” he said. For the investor believing in the internet’s future and looking to gain exposure to it in publicly traded equities, Lindzon had one word of advice: software. “The more software that you can own, the better,” he advised.

About that rebound

Yes, cash was a popular theme, and J.C. Parets of the All Star Charts blog didn’t disagree. In one of the more entertaining presentations of the day, Parets went into his bearish — but “PERFECTLY NORMAL” — outlook for the market. Through a series of charts, he revisited the idea of “unlimited downside risk” facing investors. “There’s an overwhelming amount of supply relative to demand in stocks,” so it may be time to raise cash and/or go short stocks, he said. Realistically, what kind of a drop could we see in the near term? Parets wouldn’t be surprised if we, and he’s hoping we do, wake up one morning soon to the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.79% off by 2,000 points.

Cure for cancer?

Todd Harrison, founder and CIO of investment manager CB1, traveled across the country to give an impassioned — and convincing — talk about marijuana, describing it as “God’s medicine for thousands and thousands of years.” Safe to say he’s bullish. But just how bullish? Extremely. “This is the very, very beginning of this,” he said, before dropping the “c” word. “I may not be here in a few years when ... the New York Times NYT, +0.04% reports that this kills cancer ... but, mark my words, it’s coming.” As the signal caller behind a fund focused on cannabis investments, Harrison admitted to taking a hit in recent sessions as marijuana stocks came under pressure, but he’s clearly unfazed about the prospects for the future.

The vanishing cellphone

Brian Norgard, chief product officer at Tinder, offered his thoughts on the future of the phone and how it won’t completely own us and our children until the end of time. “All great technology disappears. That’s a rule of technology. It humanizes, it miniaturizes, and it disappears,” he explained. “That’s the technology cycle that has happened since the beginning of time.” Bottom line, according to Norgard, the power of the phone will still exist, but we’ll no longer stare at a screen all day. In other words, we’ll soon start acting like humans again and find other ways to get our connected fix.

My new fave part of #stocktoberfest are my future of product and technology chats with ⁦@BrianNorgard⁩ ... pic.twitter.com/l3l7eWwjdN — Howard Lindzon (@howardlindzon) October 26, 2018

Musing about Musk

Linette Lopez covers Tesla TSLA, +2.73% for Business Insider, and she had some insight into the “shit show” of covering Elon Musk. Not one to mince words, she talked about how she felt after one of her stories was published and Tesla shares fell about 7%. “Wow, that’s pretty cool,” she remembered thinking at the time. Lopez also reminisced fondly over the saga of when Musk called her out on Twitter TWTR, +0.48% . All in all, Lopez didn’t have much good to say about the man, the company or its, and his, faithful followers. Clearly, she relishes getting under Musk’s skin.

Sober crypto investing

While bitcoin BTCUSD, +2.15% , Ethereum ETHUSD, +2.62% and the broad universe of altcoins are seeing a huge amount of downward pressure this year, Meridio CEO Mohammad Shaikh said there’s plenty of reason to be upbeat about the future of blockchain, considering the projects that are taking place. He said the speculators have given way to the smart money — endowments, sovereign-wealth funds, large asset managers — and that’s the kind of money that’s “really gonna fuel growth and build robust applications.”

"In This Time of Stock Market Uncertainty, Large-Cap Stocks Are Better","Why the End of the Bull Run Has Not Yet Materialized

What started on a promising note in early January has turned sour after the sell-off on October 24 drove the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 into a technical correction.

At the close, and prior to the oversold stock market buying that surfaced on October 25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Russell 2000 indices turned negative on the year.

Of course, with this bout of selling capitulation in the stock market, albeit far less than what we viewed in early February, the bear pundits are re-surfacing.

I even heard one bear suggest that the stock market is vulnerable to a 50% correction.

Another bear said that more nastiness was coming, but it is interesting to note that this person has been calling for a major correction since 2009.

So while I do feel that the stock market is vulnerable to additional weakness, especially if yields move higher and the U.S.-China impasse isn’t resolved, I’m not suggesting you exit stocks and stuff your mattress with cash.

The reality is that the stock market is at a crux, which always surfaces after a major run-up in stocks, and we may be in the later stages of the bull market.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX) is trading above 20, but it is still a ways off from the elevated reading of 50 during the early-February sell-off.

A closer look at the strength of the stock market shows a marked reversal in investor sentiment during the past several weeks.

Investor sentiment in the stock market is an important indicator to monitor, since it reflects the prevailing psychology of investors.

When investors are feeling gloomy like they are now, there will be a hesitancy to bid stocks higher. Of course, sentiment can easily reverse.

On the charts, October has been a wrecking ball for the stock market and, in particular, the risk on trade or higher beta stocks that tend to fall faster in a downturn.

When the stock market is rising, higher beta stocks tend to perform better and deliver alpha to investors.

At this point, the Nasdaq, the Dow Jones, the S&P 500, and the Russell 2000 are trading below their respective 50-day and 200-day moving averages. That’s a bearish sign.

Small-cap stocks are faring the worst, with the Russell 2000 down a staggering 12.9% in October and down 15.2% from its high (as of October 24).

The Nasdaq pulled out of its correction after the over-three percent bounce on October 25.

For now, the key will be whether the stock market can find some stability, but with the uncertainties in the midterm elections, yields, and trade, you should expect more volatility.

The technical picture is bearish for the stock market at this point.

The S&P 500 sold off after a bearish double top around 2,890. To make matters worse, only 18.5% of S&P 500 stocks are above their 50-day moving average, and 33.7% are above their 200-day moving average.

A look at the S&P 100 shows a similar situation, with only 17.6% and 44.1% of the stocks sitting above the respective moving averages.

Analyst Take

While a search for a bottom in the stock market may not be over, I don’t feel that a bear market is yet upon us, since the economy and earnings remain strong.

As a trader, you need to be prudent and selectively add to positions after major selling in the stock market. For now, look at adding lower beta large-cap stocks on dips, since these stocks tend to be less volatile than the small-caps in times of uncertainty."
