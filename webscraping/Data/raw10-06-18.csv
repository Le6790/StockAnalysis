The Case for a General Electric Breakup Under New CEO Larry Culp (NYSE: GE),"While firing an underperforming chief executive officer can help a company, sometimes the bad news is that more bad news is coming. This week’s firing of John Flannery as CEO of General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) should put investors on alert that a breakup of GE is now more likely than it was even back when Flannery was conducting his own review of the company.

This potential breakup became more likely after the news broke that GE was booted out of the Dow Jones industrial average. But a new CEO only will create more of a belief that a breakup of GE is more likely. And when investors consider who is taking over at GE, they probably will consider the breakup case even further.

While there is a case that GE is better off as a whole entity and that separating GE’s various debt instruments from unit to unit would be difficult, there is the very serious notion that nothing else may work. What if Wall Street continues to treat the combined General Electric as a company named General Eclectic?

Flannery bombed in convincing Wall Street that his strategy was going to turn GE around. Its new CEO is Larry Culp, who is only 55 years old. Culp previously served as chief executive officer and president of Danaher from 2000 to 2014, leading a transformation from an industrial manufacturer into a leading science and technology company. What does this tell you about GE as being an industrial manufacturing outfit?

If you look beyond the quotes in GE’s press release, the company noted that Culp effectively executed a disciplined capital allocation approach, and that he helped with a series of strategic acquisitions and dispositions and targeted investing in high-impact organic growth and margin expansion.

The GE announcement also noted that, under Culp, Danaher delivered strong free cash flow to drive long-term shareholder value and that Danaher’s market capitalization and revenues grew fivefold under his 14-year tenure.

Now break out the actual quote from Culp on assuming the CEO role:

GE remains a fundamentally strong company with great businesses and tremendous talent. It is a privilege to be asked to lead this iconic company. We will be working very hard in the coming weeks to drive superior execution, and we will move with urgency. We remain committed to strengthening the balance sheet including deleveraging. Tom and I will work with our board colleagues on opportunities for continued board renewal. We have a lot of work ahead of us to unlock the value of GE.

Also noted in last week’s news break was the turbines from the power business. GE said on Monday that it will take a noncash goodwill impairment charge related to the GE Power business and that the charge is likely to constitute substantially all the $23 billion or so tied to the unit. Also worth noting was the statement that the impairment charge is not yet finalized and remains subject to review, which means more charges may be possible (and less for that matter). Still, GE cited weaker performance in the GE Power business as the main reason for lowering its previously indicated guidance for free cash flow and in earnings per share for 2018.

Now consider how CEO Culp has an incentive to boost GE’s share price. He will receive payouts if GE’s stock rises at least 50% and can stay there for 30 consecutive trading days. The news of his hire took it up about 10% alone.

Several analysts have issued views in the wake of GE’s big CEO change.

RBC Capital Markets raised its rating to Outperform from Sector Perform and raised its price target to $15 from $13 after the CEO change.

Moody’s said that it was reviewing GE Credit for a possible downgrade, and that downgrade was more than one notch. Standard & Poor’s downgraded GE, and it is now only three notches above “junk bond” status. These both addressed weakness in power, but also both include at least inklings about GE’s future structure changing as the company tries to deleverage its balance sheet.

Merrill Lynch has only a Neutral rating but also has a $14 price objective. The firm is projecting a significant dividend cut as one of the first orders of business as the company has to shore up its balance sheet before lots of debt comes due in 2019. The Merrill Lynch report said:

We expect additional management and operational changes within GE’s segments, particularly Power… Accelerating portfolio moves announced in July could be another avenue to shore up the balance sheet, such as accelerating monetization of 62.5% BHGE ownership.

Morningstar has a $16.10 fair value estimate on GE, but it thinks that the Culp strategy may be quite similar to Flannery’s strategy. That report said:

We think Culp is the right person for CEO and should help GE realize the value of its assets. Given an outsider’s operating pedigree, we expect differences in execution under Culp, even as we suspect he’ll largely stick with GE’s current roadmap–focusing on Aviation, Power, and Renewable Energy — as laid out by Flannery and approved by the current board.

It’s hard to imagine that the future GE will look nothing like the GE that prior generations knew. That said, the world keeps on turning — and GE hasn’t been keeping up with it.

GE shares closed up 4.2% at $13.18 on Friday. That’s up nearly 17% from the $11.29 the prior Friday, before Flannery was fired and Culp was named CEO. Its 52-week trading range is now $11.21 to $24.54."

Stock market outlook: Lessons of the fall,"The mere mention of October is enough to frighten some investors, while others wonder, “What’s the big deal?” Sure, five of the stock market’s worst 10 days happened in October but overall, it’s a pretty average month for the market.

Instead, the history lessons to turn to this month are about infrequent events such as the U.S. midterm elections or when stocks appear mispriced. Here’s what investors will be watching:

About those elections. Investors are already betting on a split Congress, with Democrats possibly taking over the House. If Democrats were to gain control of both the House and Senate, that might rattle the market, said Craig Hodges, chief executive at Hodges Capital Management, which oversees six mutual funds.

Since 1946, the S&P 500 has never declined in the 12 months following midterm elections, Hodges said, citing research he has conducted. What’s more, the S&P 500 has seen an average fourth-quarter return of 7.9 percent during midterm election years, he adds.

But don’t be surprised if the stock market hits a temporary rough patch before then. “We certainly could see some volatility going into the elections,” said Matthew Etter, owner of Signet Financial Management, a registered investment adviser. That would be a departure from a relatively calm market recently.

What to do: While midterm elections could boost the market, there’s another important reason for optimism: Economic growth is solid. For Hodges, that further supports being fully invested by November, not keeping cash on the sidelines. “Any dip I would use as a real buying opportunity,” he said.

Hunt for value. Remember back in January and February when the market fell 10 percent in a matter of days? The S&P 500 fully recouped those losses by August, and the Dow Jones industrial average did so in September.

What has been good news for your portfolio has some investors feeling squeamish about investing when stock prices are high. But perspective matters, Hodges says, and some stocks look downright cheap. “There are more mispriced stocks in the market than I’ve ever seen before,” he says.

It all boils down to the two fundamental styles of investing: value (focusing on stocks that are undervalued by the market) vs. growth (seeking stocks that deliver better-than-average returns). Growth stocks have largely been this year’s “highfliers,” while value stocks are lagging behind the performance of the broader indexes. The performance differential for these different styles has become “overstretched,” which creates opportunity for long-term investors, Etter said.

Among the largest 1,000 U.S. stocks, the index tracking growth stocks has soared nearly 16 percent this year while the index tracking value stocks is up just 2 percent. Similarly, small-cap growth stocks have jumped more than 15 percent year-to-date; value stocks have risen 5.7 percent.

While it may be tempting to continue investing in the best performers, Etter said: “History has shown us that we don’t spend our entire life in a growth cycle.”

What to do: Investors looking for a tactical approach can prepare for this type of market change now by buying value stocks. Hodges sees fertile opportunities for stock-picking within small-caps, and in industries such as industrials, energy, homebuilding and transportation. Etter says exchange-traded funds offer an accessible way to attack this strategy.

Stock market forecast. Much has been made of the long shadow of the 2008 financial crisis, in light of its 10-year anniversary. Various surveys have shown that investors remain spooked.

And my, what noninvestors have missed. The S&P 500 has more than doubled in the past 10 years. That’s why the stock market remains attractive for buy-and-hold investors.

As for the outlook ahead, professionals on Wall Street forecast the S&P 500 will end the year slightly higher than its current level — up 1.7 percent, to be precise, according to the average forecast of strategists surveyed by CNBC. Still, there’s near-daily talk of an imminent market crash among other prognosticators.

Yes, you can prepare for a market crash, but when one strikes, your emotions could get the better of you. That’s why many investors prefer to remove emotion altogether by working with a financial adviser — either of the human or robo-adviser variety.

If you are navigating investing on your own, there are simple steps to take:

• Don’t try to time the market (sell when you think the market is at its peak).

• Add money to your investments regularly. This strategy, known as dollar-cost averaging, smoothens out your purchase price over time.

• Diversify your holdings across a variety of assets to reduce your overall risk.

• Accept that volatility is inherent to investing, but not something to stress about for long-term investors.

Is the great stock market crash of 2018 almost upon us?,"Investors are getting nervous. Warren Buffett — arguably the most successful investor of all time — is hoarding cash because he can’t find anything trading at a reasonable price to invest in.

Markets quietly correcting

Meanwhile, Mark Minervini — one of the most successful stock traders of modern times – owned up recently to being mostly in cash too. On 2 October he tweeted his observation that America’s Dow Jones Industrial Average (DOW) is catching the headlines by moving higher, while more than half the stocks in the Nasdaq Composite Index are trading below their 200-day moving averages. The significance of that is that there are only 30 stocks in the DOW and around 3,000 in the NASDAQ. Generally, traders consider a stock price trading below its 200-day moving average as a bearish sign.

He also thinks the Russell 2000 index is showing weakness and that’s home to around 2,000 of America’s companies, as the name suggests. His view is that “the broader market is quietly correcting” and he thinks trading conditions are “risky”. Meanwhile, many have been waiting for a significant market correction across the pond for years. If you look at charts for the DOW, Nasdaq and Russell 2000, you’ll see that they’ve all shot up rocket-like for many years without any sign of a meaningful correction. And you don’t have to look very hard to find arguments that many American firms are over-valued. Perhaps the quiet correction could become louder.

Why it matters to us

Does it all matter to us here in Blighty? After all, the median forecast price-to-earnings ratio for all shares with estimates in the UK is running at about 13 and the median forecast dividend yield of all UK dividend payers is around 3.5%. Those figures are a long way from the eye-popping valuations we’re seeing with many firms stateside. Well, I think it does matter. The problem for us in Britain is twofold. Firstly, we have a much larger proportion of cyclical businesses in our main indices, such as miners, oil companies, banks and the like, which attract much lower valuations because of their inherent cyclical risk. This means that valuation averages can deliver a false sense of safety. Secondly, there is a long history of our stock market following the big movements in America– especially the deep plunges!

We’ve also got our own problems to worry about. Nobody really knows how the act of actually leaving the European Union and its aftermath will affect the economy, company profits and share prices. That could be a catalyst for a sell-off or maybe even a relief rally once we’ve actually done it and the uncertainty has passed, because stock markets hate uncertainty more than anything else.

Yet if we do see a big correction in the markets, you can bet your bottom dollar that Warren Buffett will start seeing value again, and Mark Minervini will pin down some decent trading set-ups, and both will be filling their boots with stocks. In the meantime, I reckon a good strategy could be to keep dripping money into the stock market whatever happens next and let pound/cost averaging smooth your long-term compounded returns. There’s no need to divert your funds to baked beans and shotguns after all.

Delta Air Lines A220 takes to the skies for its first flight,"Delta will be first U.S. operator to benefit from new-generation aircraft's unbeatable efficiency

@Airbus #A220 @Delta

MIRABEL, QC, Oct. 6, 2018 /CNW Telbec/ - Delta Air Lines' first A220-100 took off on its first flight from Mirabel airport, Québec, at 2:02 p.m. local time. The aircraft was crewed by A220 programme test pilots. During successful 3-hour flight, the crew checked the aircraft's main systems and landed back in Mirabel at 4:57 p.m.

The flight took place a few days after the aircraft rolled out of the paint shop. Next, the aircraft will continue with pre-delivery testing and assembly, as elements of its state-of-the-art interior come together at the A220 assembly line. Delta's first A220 is scheduled to begin service in early 2019.

Delta Air Lines will be the first U.S. airline to operate the A220 – at the same time becoming the fourth A220 operator, after Swiss International Air Lines, airBaltic, and Korean Air. Delta is the largest A220-100 customer, with a firm order for 75 aircraft.

The A220-100 delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency. It brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney's latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft.

With an order book of over 400 aircraft to date, the A220 has all the credentials to win the lion's share of the 100- to 150-seat aircraft market, estimated to represent at least 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.
