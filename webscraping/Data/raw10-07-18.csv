Better Marijuana Stock: Tilray vs. Auxly Cannabis Group,"You've probably heard Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY) mentioned or read about the stock more times than you can keep track of over the last few weeks. The marijuana stock's phenomenal rise, fall, and rebound have certainly attracted plenty of attention.

Tilray's performance has made Auxly Cannabis Group's (NASDAQOTH: CBWTF) year-to-date gain of around 25% seem puny in comparison. Auxly definitely hasn't gotten even a fraction of the hype that Tilray has.

But which is the better marijuana stock now? Here's a quick look at how Tilray and Auxly stack up against each other.

The case for Tilray

Let's put all the buzz about Tilray's stock gyrations aside. There's more to Tilray than just the sizzle that's drawn so much attention lately.

Tilray already has a solid business supplying medical marijuana in Canada. Its potential market will soon dramatically increase. Canada's recreational marijuana market opens on Oct. 17, and Tilray has lined up supply agreements for the adult-use recreational marijuana market in eight provinces and territories, notably including the biggest prize -- Ontario.

But an even bigger opportunity for Tilray lies in international medical cannabis markets. The company recently became the first Canadian marijuana grower to win approval to supply both cannabis flower and cannabis oils to Germany. Tilray also has completed shipments of medical cannabis to Argentina, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. It even secured a green light from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to export medical cannabis to the U.S. for a clinical study.

The company shouldn't have any major problems fulfilling its supply commitments both at home and internationally. Tilray should have 912,000 square feet of growing space by the end of this year, including 230,000 square feet at its Portugal facility.

There's also a wild card that could boost Tilray's fortunes (and its stock). The company has been viewed as a top prospect for selection as a cannabis partner by a big company outside of the cannabis industry. Although nothing has materialized on this front yet, scoring a big deal with a big partner would be yet another feather in Tilray's cap.

The case for Auxly Cannabis Group

Compared to Tilray, Auxly Cannabis Group has flown under the radar. However, there's a lot to like about the company and its business model.

Auxly used to be known as Cannabis Wheaton, in homage to Wheaton Precious Metals (formerly Silver Wheaton), the largest silver streaming company in the world. Auxly's founders liked the royalty streaming model that has worked well in the precious metals industry and applied it to the cannabis industry. This streaming model involves providing funds to other companies in exchange for a share of future products, future revenue, and/or equity interest.

Today, Auxly claims five wholly owned subsidiaries and 13 streaming partners. These businesses operate across the supply chain of the cannabis industry, giving Auxly strong vertical integration.

Most of Auxly's focus so far has been in Canada. The company has made multiple acquisitions and streaming deals with marijuana producers to the extent that it expects to have an annual production capacity of 160,000 kilograms by 2021, making it one of at least seven Canadian marijuana growers on track to top the 100,000-kilogram mark. Auxly believes that its funded capacity ranks it fourth among Canadian marijuana growers.

However, Auxly also has ventured outside of its home country. The company recently announced it was buying an 80% stake in Inverell, a licensed cannabis operator in Uruguay. This deal is pending approval by Uruguayan regulators. If it goes through, Auxly will have a great source for low-cost production of cannabidiol (CBD) to export to other countries.

Better marijuana stock

I've intentionally avoided talking about valuation so far. But to determine which of these two marijuana stocks is the better pick for investors, we have to address the elephant in the room.

Tilray's market cap stands north of $14 billion. Auxly Cannabis Group's market cap is less than $500 million. While Auxly stock isn't cheap, I think it's a much better bargain than Tilray. If you could only choose one of these two marijuana stocks, my view is that Auxly is the hands-down winner.

Of course, investors have plenty of other options. While I like Auxly over Tilray, I wouldn't go out on a limb by recommending the stock as a buy. Marijuana stocks, in general, are probably too risky for many investors. And for aggressive investors, my view is that there are even better ways to profit from growth in the global cannabis industry.

"The economy is doing great. But GM, GE and General Mills are getting left behind","New York (CNN Business) 1. Bears in a bull market: The American economy is firing on all cylinders — but three of its storied companies are getting left behind.

General Motors has lost $1.5 billion in market value since its 2010 IPO . General Mills ( GIS ) is grappling with a sales slump in North America. And General Electric's ( GE ) market cap is smaller than any time since the Great Recession.

These three American brands, for vastly different reasons, are stuck in bear markets during the longest bull market in Wall Street history. It's a fresh reminder that even the most iconic companies are targets for disruption in today's fast-moving world.

Take General Mills, the 152-year-old maker of Cheerios, Haagen-Dazs and Betty Crocker. Like other packaged food companies, General Mills was slow to adapt to the shifting preferences of shoppers.

Americans have shelved sugary cereals and yogurts in favor of healthier breakfast meals. That swing has hurt General Mills, which owns Yoplait, Trix, Lucky Charms and Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

The company has responded by rolling out new brands -- and jumping headfirst into the booming market for pet food, a category it left half a century ago. Desperate for growth, General Mills splurged $8 billion on high-end pet food maker Blue Buffalo earlier this year. But even that brand's sales have slowed under the ownership of General Mills.

No wonder General Mills shares have plunged 40% since peaking in July 2016.

The auto industry has gone in reverse in recent months because of trade uncertainty and higher borrowing costs. And GM is no exception. Its Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands all suffered sales declines last quarter. All told, GM's sales fell 11%.

The good news is that GM is in the driver's seat on self-driving cars, at least among traditional auto makers. GM's self-driving car unit, known as Cruise, received a $750 million injection from Honda last week. The investment values Cruise at nearly $15 billion.

And then there's GE. The once-great conglomerate has lost nearly half a trillion in value over the past 18 years.

Under former CEO Jeff Immelt, GE doubled down on fossil fuels at precisely the wrong time by acquiring France's Alstom, a maker of turbines in coal plants. Now, GE's power division is crumbling due to the rise of renewable energy.

Saddled with heavy debt from years of bad deals, GE has been forced to raise cash by dismantling its empire . GE is saying goodbye to its health care, railroad and oil-and-gas divisions. Even the light bulb busines s is going away.

GE is in such disarray that it has handed the keys to Larry Culp, the first outsider CEO in the company's 126-year history. Relieved that GE is finally trying something new, Wall Street sent GE shares spiking 17% last week -- their best week since 2009.

During the first half of the year, tax cuts helped drive bank profits to new Several banks report earnings on Friday, including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and PNC Financial.

One notable exception is Wells Fargo, which also will report its finances before the bell on Friday. Wells Fargo has spent the last two years moving from crisis to crisis. The nightmare is still hurting its business: Bottom-line growth has stalled, and the bank remains in the penalty box with regulators.

3. Turbulence? Delta Air Lines ( Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) reports earnings on Thursday and investors will be watching jet fuel prices carefully.

Airlines have been plagued this year by rising oil prices, which have pinched profits. Delta's stock is down 6% this year. American Airlines is down 29%, and Southwest has fallen 7%.

4. Google's big event: It's Google's turn for a splashy gadget event on Tuesday. Hardware is a small part of Google's business, but Android and Google Assistant are crucial to the future of Alphabet.

It's expected to debut a new Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL phone, more Google Home devices (perhaps a speaker with a screen) and showcase what it plans to do with its mobile and voice software.

5. Consumer sentiment: The University of Michigan will release its monthly consumer sentiment report Friday. Consumer sentiment unexpectedly jumped in September to its second-strongest measurement in 2018. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expect sentiment to fall slightly to 98.5 this month, down from 100.8 last month -- but still historically high.

6. Coming this week:

Monday — US bond market closed for Columbus Day; Nobel Prize in economics announced

Tuesday — Google hardware event

Thursday — Delta ( — Delta ( DAL ) earnings; Walgreens Boots Alliance ( WBA ); Deadline for Sky shareholders to accept Comcast offer; Monthly OPEC report"

The weakness on Wall Street came as treasury yields extended a recent upward move following the release of the monthly jobs report, adding to concerns about the outlook for interest rates.

While the Labor Department report showed weaker than expected job growth in September, the jump in employment in August was upwardly revised and the unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent for its lowest level since 1969.

Also, the Commerce Department showed the U.S. trade deficit widened in August, reflecting an increase in imports and a decrease in exports.

Crude oil prices retreated after edging higher early on in the session on Friday, as traders weighed the decision of Russia and Saudi Arabia to increase output. Crude oil futures for November ended at $74.34 a barrel, gaining a penny."
