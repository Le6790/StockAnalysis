Nike Stock Upgraded For 'Embracing The Power Of Digital',"Nike (NKE) has been upgraded over an ongoing digital revolution an analyst believes will 'underpin improved results at the company.'

Oppenheimer raised its Nike stock rating from perform to outperform under the reasoning its initiatives in areas such as online retail and artificial intelligence will enhance an already dominant global brand. The price target is $90.

""A technological evolution is underway at NKE, whereby management is embracing the power of digital as a means to enhance most all aspects of NKE's business model, including consumer connections, product innovation, and manufacturing,"" Oppenheimer managing director Brian Nagel said in a research note.

Despite the upgrade, the Dow Jones stock fell 1.15% to 75.60 on the stock market today. Nike stock has fallen sharply in October, tumbling through its 50-day line and failing a breakout.

Rival Adidas (ADDYY) was down 2.3%. Under Armour (UAA) slid 2.6%, Skechers (SKX) was off 2.1% and Deckers Outdoor (DECK) dipped 0.5%.

Nike stock has good, but not ideal, fundamentals, which is reflected in its IBD Composite Rating of 91. The stock is up sharply in 2018. Nike earnings growth has accelerated for the past four quarters. It also posted double-digit sales growth in the last two quarters.

Digital Offensive Powers Nike Stock

The cornerstones for Nike going forward are its Consumer Direct Offense operating strategy and its Triple Double Strategy.

The Triple Double initiative focuses on three areas: innovation, forging more direct interaction with consumers and cutting the time required to bring a product to market by half, to less than nine months.

On the innovation front, Nike has been snapping up companies as it beefs up its digital offerings. Back in March it acquired consumer data analytics company Zodiac for an undisclosed sum. And in April it snapped up body scanning software firm Invertex, an Israeli fashion technology firm that developed the FeetID system, which can scan and size shoppers' feet and send that data directly to their mobile phone within seconds.

Oppenheimer's Nagel believes Wall Street has yet to fully appreciate just how key the overarching Nike strategy driving these acquisitions will be in the coming years.

""Investors have still yet to grasp fully the degree to which a now enhanced business model of Nike will help to underpin improved results at the company, near and longer term.""

Nike 'Through Recent Woes'

While Nagel believes sales will increase as management's internal initiatives take hold, he also said the wider signs are good. He believes the broader athletic group is ""now through recent woes,"" and sales are on the upswing.

However he believes digital will add even more upside as it will allow Nike to ""drive sales through more profitable direct channels and minimize markdown risks by producing on-trend product faster.""

Nagel also said the backdrop for the sector is favorable for Nike stock, whose value he said is ""accommodative.""

""Over the next few years, the global sportswear market is expected to expand by an annual mid-single digit rate, with China and Asia-Pacific and Latin America outpacing more mature markets of North America and Europe,"" he said. ""In (fiscal 2018), international accounted for over 55 percent of Nike brand revenues.""

"Dow Dips on Hawkish Fed Minutes, Bond Yields Rise as Powell Faces Down Trump","The Thursday Market Minute

Global stocks weaken as investors re-price risk following a hawkish reading of the latest Fed minutes that suggests near-term rate hikes will continue as the domestic economy expands and inflation accelerates.

China stocks fall to a four-year low in the face of a firmer dollar and rising bond yields, with little relief coming from a U.S. Treasury report that stopped short of labeling Beijing as a currency manipulator.

European stocks edge lower amid a series of top-tier corporate earnings, including better-than-expected quarterly performances from Nestle and Carrefour and a bullish cloud outlook from SAP.

U.S. equity futures point to a softer open on Wall Street with markets eyeing rising 10-year Treasury yields, which hit 3.21% overnight, and earnings from Dow components American Express and Travelers Companies and online payments systems group PayPal.

Market Snapshot

Global stocks weakened Thursday, with benchmarks in China falling to the lowest level in four years, after a hawkish set of minutes from last month's Federal Reserve meeting cemented the case for near-term rate hikes, pulling both the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields higher.

Minutes of the Fed's September 26 rate decision, which lifted the central bank's benchmark rate to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% for its third hike, suggested that Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues won't be swayed by criticism from President Donald Trump, who has said they're moving ""too fast"" to tighten policy and are threatening the health of the U.S. economy.

The Fed said a gradual approach to rate hikes, set against accelerating inflation and robust growth, would ""balance the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, which could lead to an abrupt slowing in the economy and inflation moving below the Committee's objective, against the risk of moving too slowly, which could engender inflation persistently above the objective and possibly contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances.""

The minutes helped boost the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global currencies, more than 0.2% to a one-week high of 95.77 in overnight trading and pushed benchmark Treasury bond yields 2.8 basis points higher to 3.21%, close to the 2011 high of 3.251% that triggered last week's sharp sell-off in U.S. stocks.

Overnight in Asia, the rising yields and firmer dollar pressured stocks around the region, with the Nikkei 225 falling 0.8% to close at 22,658.16 points while sharp, 2%-plus declines for benchmarks in China pushed stocks to a four-year low and dragged the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index 0.65% lower into the final hours of trading.

Curiously, there was little relief for currency markets after the U.S. Treasury stopped short of naming China as a currency manipulator in its twice-yearly report to Congress, with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin instead expressing ""particular concern"" for the lack of transparency in Beijing over foreign exchange market interventions.

Early indications from U.S. equity futures suggest the rising bond yields may hold down gains on Wall Street later today, with contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicating a 55 point opening bell decline while those linked to the S&P 500 suggest an 8 point pullback for the broader benchmark.

Dow components American Express (AXP) and Travelers Companies (TRV) will report third quarter earnings before the start of trading today, with reports from PayPal Holdings (PYPL) , Philip Morris (PM) , PPG Industries (PPG) and Nucor (NUE) also expected throughout the session.

European stocks, however, were stronger by mid-day in Frankfurt, with the Stoxx 600 benchmark rising 0.2% amid a host of blue-chip earnings around the region, including packaged food giant Nestle (NSRGY) , which confirmed its full-year sales growth guidance of around 3%, and Carrefour SA (CRRFY) , the world's second-largest retailer, which had better-than-expected third quarter numbers in it home French market and its challenging Brazil segment.

Global oil prices also extended declines in early European trading, following yesterday's sharp declines sparked by a bigger-than-expected buildup in domestic crude stocks of 6.5 million barrels, a stronger U.S. dollar and persistent questions over near-term demand from China as the world's second-largest economy continues to show signs of slowing."

Markets slide on weak earnings; tech skid resumes,"By Marley Jay | Associated Press

NEW YORK — U.S. stocks slumped again Thursday as investors continued to sell shares of technology and internet companies, industrials, and companies that rely on consumer spending.

Several industrial companies tumbled after releasing weak quarterly reports, and European stocks also fell as European Union leaders criticized Italy’s spending plans.

At the start of trading, stocks took small losses as bond prices fell and interest rates spiked. While the gain in interest rates didn’t last, stocks turned lower late in the morning, and by the end of the day they had wiped away most of their big rally on Tuesday.

The S&P 500 fell 40 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,768. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 327 points, or 1.3 percent, to 25,379. It was down as much as 470 earlier.

The Nasdaq gave up 157 points, or 2.1 percent, to 7,485. The Russell 2000 of smaller-company stocks fell 28 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,560.

Stocks have skidded over the last two weeks, and there are signs investors are worried about future economic growth. The S&P 500 has fallen 5.5 percent in volatile trading since Oct. 3, and technology, industrial and energy companies have taken some of the biggest losses. Those companies tend to do better when the economy is growing more quickly and consumers and businesses have more money to spend.

Industrial and basic materials companies have taken bigger losses than any other part of the market over the last month, and one reason is that investors feel they are especially vulnerable in the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China. They’re already dealing with tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which have increased their costs and can also hurt sales.

“If uncertainty starts to creep in around trade or growth, that could be a risk to the recovery in … corporate spending,” said Jill Carey Hall, senior U.S. equity strategist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

The stocks that have held up the best include utility and household products companies. They don’t depend as much on economic growth, as consumers are likely to use about the same amount of electricity and buy the same amount of toilet paper or cereal regardless of the state of the economy.

European leaders expressed concern about the Italian government’s plans to increase spending and widen its budget deficit. European Union budget chief Pierre Moscovici told Italy’s economic minister that the government’s plans make it unlikely that Italy will be able to reduce its public debt to levels agreed upon by EU countries.

Italy’s FTSE MIB dropped 1.9 percent and Italian government bond prices dropped again, sending yields to their highest levels since February of 2014. Germany’s DAX dipped 1.1 percent. The French CAC 40 lost 0.5 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain slipped 0.4 percent.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 index sank 0.8 percent and the Kospi in South Korea lost 0.9 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was little changed, and remained near its lowest level since May 2017."
