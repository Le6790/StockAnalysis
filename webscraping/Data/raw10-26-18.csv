"Dow Ends Tough Week of Trading on Sour Note, Nasdaq has Market's Worst Sell Off","Here Are 3 Hot Things to Know About Stocks Right Now

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday but came off sharp lows from earlier in the session. The S&P 500 was declining, with the index headed for its seventh loss in eight days.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) fell 7.8% after a light revenue outlook and slower international growth from the online retailing giant.

Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was down 2.2% after the parent of Google posted third-quarter profit that beat estimates but top-line growth came up shy of expectations.

Wall Street Overview

Stocks were lower Friday, Oct. 26, but rebounded from sharper losses earlier in the session that were triggered by disappointing earnings and outlooks from some of the world's biggest companies.

Third-quarter updates from tech giants Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) had undercut investor sentiment in markets around the world as growth projections slowed in the face of escalating trade disputes, rising interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar. Alphabet shares turned higher at midday but again moved into the red.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 298 points, or 1.2%, to 24,686; at its low for the day the index declined 539 points. The S&P slid 1.74%, and the Nasdaq dropped 2.06%. Stocks rebounded on Thursday, Oct. 25, as investors pinned their hopes on strong corporate earnings. The Dow jumped 401 points, or 1.63%, to 24,984, the S&P 500 gained 1.86%, and the Nasdaq rose 2.95%.

Third-quarter gross domestic product slipped to a 3.5% annual pace, down from 4.2% in the second quarter. Economists polled by FactSet expected GDP of 3.3% on an annualized basis.

Amazon slid 7.8% on Friday after a light revenue outlook and slower international growth from the online retailing giant overshadowed a strong earnings beat and continued services momentum.

Amazon posted quarterly earnings of $5.75 a share, easily beating estimates of $3.08, but third-quarter revenue of $56.58 billion fell short of a $57.11 billion consensus.

Revenue at Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $6.68 billion, falling slightly short of estimates of $6.71 billion. Growth slowed a bit from the second quarter's 49%, but remained above the year-earlier period's 42%.

For its seasonally big fourth quarter, Amazon guided for revenue of $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion and operating income of $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion, which are below consensus estimates of $73.79 billion and $3.86 billion, respectively.

""We believe the lighter than consensus guidance in Amazon's biggest quarter (fourth-quarter holiday season) is the main source of the stock falling in the after-hours market,"" said Jim Cramer and the Action Alerts PLUS team, which holds Amazon in its portfolio. ""Investors are likely focusing on the top line miss too, but we believe this is the incorrect view of the company because it has transformed over the past few quarters.""

Alphabet fell 2.2% after the parent of Google posted third-quarter profit of $13.06 a share on revenue of $33.7 billion, beating bottom-line estimates of $10.41 a share but missing top-line expectations of $34.04 billion.

Advertising continues to be Alphabet's biggest cash cow, with ad revenue on Google platforms accounting for about 70% of net revenue in recent years, growing about 20% annually. In the third quarter, Google's advertising revenue totaled $28.95 billion, with Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat noting in the earnings report that momentum was ""led by mobile search and our many products that help billions of people every day.""

""All in, despite the various achievements in the quarter, there is no sugar coating it, the release was ugly,"" said Cramer and the Action Alerts PLUS team, which holds Alphabet in its portfolio.

Intel Corp. (INTC) rose 3.1% on Friday after the chipmaker posted third-quarter earnings of $1.40 a share on revenue of $19.16 billion, topping analysts' forecasts of $1.15 a share and revenue of $18.13 billion.

Intel lifted its full-year revenue guidance to $71.2 billion from $69.5 billion and its full-year earnings expectations to $4.53 a share from $4.15.

Snap Inc. (SNAP) declined 10.3% after the social-media company posted a decline in daily active users though quarterly earnings and revenue beat Wall Street estimates.

Snap said its daily active user count was 186 million, matching expectations. That fell from 188 million in the previous quarter.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) rose 3.4% after third-quarter earnings topped forecasts but same-store sales growth of 4.4% missed expectations.

Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) fell 6.7% after third-quarter adjusted earnings of 72 cents a share matched Wall Street estimates but revenue missed."
"U.S. stocks finish lower as S&P 500, Dow turn negative for 2018","U.S. stocks closed lower Friday with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average turning red for the year as doubts about whether equities can count on support from corporate earnings emerged in the wake of disappointing results from a handful of megacap companies.

How did major benchmarks fare?

After falling more than 500 points earlier, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.79% trimmed losses to drop 296.24 points, or 1.2%, to 24,688.31. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.82% fell 46.88 points, or 1.7%, to 2,658.69. The Nasdaq Composite Index NQZ8, +0.77% retreated 151.12 points, or 2.1%, to 7,167.21.

For the week, the Dow is off 3%, the S&P 500 3.9% and the Nasdaq is down 3.8% while for the month of October so far, the S&P has lost 8.8%, the Dow is down 6.7%, and the Nasdaq has shed 11%. Friday’s downdraft also pulled the S&P 500 and the blue-chip index into the red for 2018. The Nasdaq is still up 3.8% year-to-date although the tech-heavy benchmark entered correction territory on Wednesday, when it closed more than 10% below its recent highs.

What drove the market?

Investors were wary ahead of the weekend amid persistent worries about slowing global growth, rising interest rates and concerns that companies have seen peak earnings growth.

Not helping the mood was disappointing results from big corporations. Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.99% posted a record profit but sales disappointed, and more important, its forecast for fourth-quarter sales — the all-important holiday shopping period — was below analysts’ expectations.

Trade worries were also simmering after U.S. officials reportedly said talks with China won’t resume until Beijing comes up with solid proposals over forced technology transfers and other economic issues.

Which data were in focus?

The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew 3.5% in the third quarter, beating forecaster estimates of 3.4%. Second-quarter growth held at 4.2%.

The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index came in at 98.6, below the consensus estimate of 99.

What were analysts saying?

Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell, said that the declines were sparked by disappointing quarterly reports from Amazon and Alphabet Inc., but the bigger concern is where the global economy is headed in 2019. “All the macro issues, from higher interest rates to slowing growth in China are giving us a half-glass-empty situation regarding 2019 earnings,” he told MarketWatch.

The speed and magnitude of the declines, he argued, is also a concern. “This is a dangerous time, a fluid time, and the market looks like a falling knife, and so were looking at a buyer’s strike,” he said, in which investors retreat for the sidelines and wait for the market to bottom out.

“The market’s mood swings have been unsettling, but the underlying conditions that triggered the rout are unlikely to shatter the economic or earnings cycles. We think this will all sort out, but it will take some time,” said Kelly Bogdanova, vice president of portfolio advisory group at RBC Wealth Management, in a note.

Which stocks are in focus?

Amazon.com AMZN, +0.99% shares are down 7.8% after the retailer lowered its guidance for holiday sales figures.

Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.38% shares slid 1.8% after the search-engine giant beat on earnings but fell short on revenue target.

Intel Corp. INTC, +3.38% shares rose 3.1% after the company’s quarterly results and outlook beat analyst estimates.

Share of Expedia Group Inc. EXPE, +0.88% gained 2.5% following the release of quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street expectations.

Charter Communications Inc. CHTR, -0.34% shed 6.3% following the release of revenue numbers the fell short of analysts’ estimates.

How were other markets trading?

Asian stocks fell, led by a 1% drop for the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.21% and a 0.8% fall for the Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.40% European markets struggled as well.

The yen USDJPY, +0.00% and gold prices GCZ8, -0.16% were higher, indicative of investors seeking out perceived safer havens and oil prices US:CLZ8 were stronger.

"A bumpy ride to the end, stock market closes the week nearly in correction territory","CLOSE Overconfidence and bias are among the biggest mistakes for investors who want to protect their 401k savings. USA TODAY

A chart showing a stock price moving higher (Photo: Getty Images)

Stocks offered plenty of heart-stopping moments Friday, finally ending the week just beats from an official correction.

The broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index closed down 1.73 percent, or 9.28 percent from its peak on Sept. 20. A correction is a loss of at least 10 percent from the most recent high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 296 points, or 1.19 percent and almost 8 percent from its high on Oct. 3.

Investors continue to fret over ongoing trade uncertainties and rising interest rates and how those factors could dampen corporate earnings and future economic growth. Disappointing revenue from Amazon and lower-than-expected earnings from Google late Thursday soured investors and helped fuel Friday’s sell-off.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed down 2.06 percent, with shares in Amazon losing 7.82 percent and Google stock down 2.2 percent.

Market watchers head into the weekend wondering what’s next.

“Has it run its course or will it continue and move onto something more substantial?” says David A. Schneider, principal of Schneider Wealth Strategies in New York.

So what has gotten Wall Street all worked up?

Slowdown in corporate profits

While the 500 companies in the S&P 500 are on track for a third consecutive quarter of 20 percent-plus profit growth, investors appear to be worried about weaker results next year.

Analysts have been lowering their earnings projections for 2019 amid fears that the U.S. economy will move closer to its next recession as the benefits from fiscal stimulus such as tax cuts fade and overseas growth contracts. While S&P 500 profits for full-year 2018 are seen growing by more than 23 percent, analysts see the pace of growth slowing to 10 percent next year, according to data from earnings tracker Refinitiv.

In short, one of the main planks of the bull's upbeat market call – robust corporate profitability – is being called into question.

""We really need to see some expectation-beating earnings reports to remind investors why we got to these levels in the first place,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda said in an email. Unfortunately, he adds, profit growth is ""expected to soften.""

Damage from rising interest rates

A main driver of the 9-year-old bull run has been historically low interest rates. Cheap borrowing costs benefited consumers and boosted spending, as Americans were able to get loans for homes and cars more cheaply and pay lower rates on credit-card debt. Similarly, cheap money enabled businesses to grow their businesses and buy back shares of their own stocks, which boosted their earnings per share due to fewer shares for purchase in the market.

But with the cost of borrowed money going up as the U.S. central bank boosts short-term interest rates, the outlook for the economy and stocks looks less attractive.

Any market bounces will prove temporary, as investors become even more worried about the outlook for the U.S. economy, Oliver Jones of U.K. investment firm Capital Economics warns.

Obstacles from overseas

Friction caused by the trade dispute between the U.S. and China has already started to have a negative impact on the results of some U.S. companies. Many CEOs have said they are facing higher costs for things such as steel and aluminum, parts for cars and computer chips. If tensions between the world's two biggest economies worsen, the negative drag on the U.S. and global economy could worsen.

What’s ahead

Next week is another big week for earnings. All eyes will be on those companies and their expectations for future growth. The week also ends with the government’s employment report for October. Another strong report will back the Federal Reserve’s case for future rate hikes and could reignite investor concerns.

Charter Stock Dips 9% as Dow Falls 400 Points,"Charter Communications shares fell nearly 10% on Friday despite reporting better than expected Q3 results and amid an overall market sell-off that forced the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 400 points in early trading.

Charter shares fell as much as 9.7% ($30.44 each) to $284.37 in early trading Friday. The stock was trading at $291.12 per share, down 7.5% ($23.69 each) by 10:55 a.m. on Oct. 26. At that same time, the Dow was down about 445 points.

The company had reported better than expected Q3 customer results before the market opened, but a miss on cash flow growth – up 3.5% instead of consensus estimates of a 5% rise and a slight miss on revenue, $10.9 billion versus consensus of 10.96 billion – apparently was enough to trigger a sell-off.

In a research note before the market opened, Evercore ISI media analyst Vijay Jayant said he expected Charter to trade flat to down on Friday despite the steady Q3 results, mainly because of comparisons to Comcast, which reported record Q3 high-speed data customer growth Thursday.

The rest of the cable distribution sector was fairly unscathed in the Dow’s descent early Friday – most cable stocks were down between 1% and 2% in early trading. Altice USA, which has yet to report Q3 earnings, was down about 5.8% (96 cents) to $15.42 each at 10:55 a.m. Oct. 26, perhaps in anticipation of further bad news for cable distributors.

Disappointing tech stock earnings triggered the Dow plunge, as Amazon and Google each reported lower than expected sales numbers. Amazon shares were down as much as 10% early in the trading session and Google fell as much as 5.4% in early trading

Charter said in a conference call with analysts that it is winding down its integration of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, which it purchased in 2016, and should be finished by the end of the year.

That integration, which included converting much of the TWC and Bright House legacy footprint to digital, buying additional set-top boxes and stepping up broadband speeds, required additional capital expenditures and disrupted the overall operations, chairman and CEO Tom Rutledge told analysts Friday. But those pressures will be substantially eased as the integration is completed.

“We spent a lot of money to upgrade the network to all-digital,” Rutledge said.

Rutledge said TWC’s analog plant had three negative attributes: it ate up spectrum that could otherwise be used for broadband and IP video, it had an inferior picture, and it required deploying new set-tops to every home to fix it.

“That capital to buy the set-top boxes, to roll the trucks and the disruption in the operating business and the impact that has on phone traffic and service calls and therefore the ability to focus on sales, all of that impacted both 2017 and 2018,” Rutledge said.

At the same time, Rutledge was optimistic that recent weakness in the satellite and virtual MVPD sector, could translated into stronger numbers for cable going forward. AT&T said its DirecTV satellite TV service lost about 359,000 net new subscribers in Q3 and its OTT service DirecTV Now added a disappointing 49,000 customers.

“I’ve said all along that I thought the shrinking of the satellite business would benefit our video business, but then you’ve got these other trends as well, including recent price increases in the virtual MVPD space, which probably impacted their results too,” Rutledge said. “…Satellite is a very high-priced single product, with $100 ARPUs in a world where the content is devalued. I think you’ll see continued erosion of that business, and some of that will shift to us.”"
Battered Dow rebounds: can the stock market bounce last?,"CLOSE Bear Market is a term that sends fear into Wall Street and investors. What does it mean? And how does it affect both Wall Street and Main Street? Adam Shell explains.

Just when it looked like the stock market would never stop going down, it reversed course and went up a lot.

The bounce Thursday was a big relief to jittery investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 401 points, erasing some of the sting from the previous three-day rout that knocked it down 860 points. The rebound rally put the Dow back in positive territory for the year.

Wall Street pros cited a number of factors to explain the move higher.

* Stocks got ""oversold:"" The big washout suffered in Wednesday's 608-point Dow drop caused stocks to get too beat up and investor sentiment to get too gloomy. But that day's pain came on lower trading volume than the two-day plunge ending on Oct. 11. ""That shows a decline in selling pressure,"" says Mark Arbeter, president of Arbeter Investments.

* Good earnings news: A slew of strong profit reports from high-profile companies, ranging from software giant Microsoft to social media player Twitter to electric-car maker Tesla, reaffirmed the strength of the American economy and leading companies, says Bill Hornbarger, chief investment strategist at Moneta Group. More strong results in coming days will be needed for the market rebound to hold.

* Panic selling dries up: The market's recent slide looked more like panic selling than investors making rational investment decisions, says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. But the strong earnings reports allowed investors to recognize ""that things are not as bad"" as the recent swoon suggest.

But what matters now, is what comes next?

Hornbarger says it's a ""little too early to signal the all clear.""

Investors, he says, should brace themselves for more wild swings as Wall Street weighs a pretty positive economic backdrop against fears that things could get worse if rising interest rates, trade tensions and slowing growth in China start eating into corporate profits.

Arbeter, however, says the worst of the recent bout of selling is ""most likely over"" – at least for now. He's watching to see if the broad market can climb back above its prior high notched in September and above its average price over the past 200 days. If it can, it would suggest the market trend remains up.

The Dow drops 300 points and tech stock get whacked,"Spencer Platt/Getty

Stocks fell Friday as a technology sell-off rattled global markets.

Wall Street wiped out its 2018 gains for a second time this week.

Follow the US indices in real time here.

US stocks tumbled in a volatile day of trading Friday as a technology rout rattled global markets, with concerns about rising rates and the prospect of slowing economic growth around the world wiping out Wall Street's 2018 gains for the second time this week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared losses to close down about 300 points, or 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite shed more than 2%, and the S&P 500 ended down 1.7% after briefly dipping into correction territory. The sell-off turned both the Dow and the S&P 500 negative for the year, with stocks on track for their worst October since the financial crisis.

High-flying technology companies took the biggest hits after posting disappointing earnings. Amazon's revenue fell short of expectations and its fourth-quarter guidance disappointed, sending shares into a bear market, down more than 20% from their peak. Google parent company Alphabet beat on the bottom line, but missed on revenue. Snap hit an all-time low after the company said it lost 2 million daily users.

""While a lot of the recent sell-off (and headlines) have been dominated by tech, the sell-off has been very broad-based in nature,"" Scott Buchta, head of fixed income strategy at Brean Capital, wrote in an email.

""Although this morning’s GDP report may help bring some near-term calm to the markets, we expect to see intraday volatility remain elevated due to the technical nature of the markets (driven largely by algos).""

Before the open, the Commerce Department said the US economy grew in July through September at a slightly slower pace than a blockbuster expansion earlier in the year, marking the best back-to-back quarters since 2014. With strong consumer spending offsetting weaker investment and exports, gross domestic product rose at a seasonally adjusted 3.5% in the third-quarter.

""In one line: Strong GDP growth hides soft capex and massive trade deterioration,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

Investors moved to the relative safety of US government bonds, which move inversely to yields, with the 10-year falling 3.9 basis points to 3.077%, its lowest level in three weeks. Gold, another safehaven, jumped to its highest level since July — at around $1,234 per ounce.

Meanwhile, the dollar climbed to its highest levels since 2017 against a basket of peers. The Chinese yuan fell past 6.9700 against the greenback, a two-year low."
"Stocks plunge again, S&P 500 enters correction","US equities slipped Friday after underwhelming quarterly financial results from major internet companies unnerved markets.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.74%, or 47 points, at the end of trading Friday. The Dow (^DJI) tumbled 1.19%, or 296.24 points. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell 2.06%, or 151.12 points.

Friday’s rout sent the S&P 500 into corrective territory. At its intraday low, the S&P 500 was down 10.6% from its September 21 year-to-date intraday high of 2,940.91. The Nasdaq entered a correction on October 11. The Dow is down 8.4% from its record high of 26,951.81.

This comes even as companies have actually been reporting relatively strong earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist of Credit Suisse, wrote in a note Friday. Earnings per share are beating estimates by “an impressive 6.1%,” and year-over-year growth is on target to top 26%, or 18% after tax benefits are excluded, he wrote.

“Despite these impressive realities, investors seem convinced that higher input costs and China-related trade issues are in the process of undermining corporate profitability,” Golub said. “Management guidance has emphasized these concerns, which appear quite overstated relative to the numbers. Unfortunately, the market seems more focused on what it hears rather than what it sees.”

A stronger-than-expected first estimate of economic growth did little to help indices pare losses, with an advance reading of gross domestic product registering above consensus expectations.

ECONOMY: GDP grows at faster-than-expected pace

The US economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.5% during the third quarter of 2018, according to first estimates released Friday from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This represented a slowdown from the 4.2% pace of growth in the previous period but came in above consensus expectations of a 3.3% rate anticipated by economists. The Trump administration has set a target rate of 3% growth for the US economy.

“Overall the data suggest a modest deceleration after a very strong Q2, with the slowdown led, as expected, by the net export category, with a rebound in inventories countering some of that,” Dave Lutz, an analyst with JonesTrading Annapolis, wrote in a note Friday.

Growth in personal consumption expenditures contributed to the higher-than-expected reading for GDP. Consumer spending, comprising a majority of economic activity, grew at a pace of 4%, or its highest level since 2014. This exceeded the 3.3% pace expected by economists and 3.8% rate from the second quarter.

The personal consumption expenditures index, a measure of underlying inflation, registered at 1.6% quarter-over-quarter, a decrease from the second quarter’s reading of 2.1%. Consensus estimates had been for 1.8%.

The University of Michigan’s reading for consumer sentiment weakened to 98.6 for October from 100.1 in September, coming in slightly short of estimates of a reading of 99. The current economic conditions gauge capturing Americans’ perceptions of their own finances fell to 113.1 from 115.2 in September.

The headline sentiment index has been higher so far in 2018 than in any year since 2000, Richard Curtin, Surveys of Consumers chief economist, noted in the release.

“Importantly, stock price declines, rising inflation and interest rates, and the negative mid-term election campaigns, have not acted to undermine consumer confidence,” Curtin said. “Needless to say, consumers are not immune to these negative factors. The data only indicate that the tipping point toward escalating pessimism has not been reached.”

STOCKS: Alphabet, Amazon disappoint

Google-parent company Alphabet (GOOG) beat on earnings but fell short of average analyst expectations for revenue in its quarterly report Thursday. Earnings came in at $13.06 per share versus consensus estimates of $10.42 per share, while revenue registered at $33.7 billion against expectations of $34.04 billion. Google’s advertising business continued to comprise the largest chunk of the company’s revenue, coming in at 85.8% in the third quarter. Shares of Alphabet fell 2.2% to $1,071.47 each as of market close Friday."
Dow Jones Industrial Average Plunges 290 Points as Tech Stocks Miss Earnings Expectations,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 290 points at Friday's opening bell after Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell short of earnings expectations. The disappointing third-quarter reports and guidance sent all major indexes into the red, pushing the S&P 500 into correction territory.

The Top Stock Market Stories for Friday

The market roller coaster continued as markets prepared for the U.S. government to release its third-quarter GDP report. This morning, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that Q3 GDP growth came in at 3.5%, a figure that topped expectations. Investors were concerned that the stimulus from tax cuts had begun to fade from the balance sheets of companies while tariffs ate into profits and interest rate hikes slashed investor enthusiasm. Today's report suggests that the impact of tariffs and interest rate hikes has yet to take full effect.

In an unprecedented move, the European Union has rejected Italy's latest budget plan. The news sent bond prices higher and will force Italian finance ministers to go back to the drawing board. Debt has plagued the Italian economy. In 2017, the country spent as much money servicing its debt as it did on public education. This was the first time that the EU ever rejected a member nation's draft proposal for a budget.

Finally, rising interest rates continue to batter the U.S. housing market. Sales of new and existing homes have slowed to a crawl. Meanwhile, homeowners are speculating on when would be the right time to sell their homes if we are in the middle of another bubble. Money Morning's Lee Adler offers his insight into the signs of another housing crisis and what you should do if the warning signs begin to creep up on us again. Go here now.
