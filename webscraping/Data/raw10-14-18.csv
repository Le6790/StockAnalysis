Saudi stocks plunge on fear of sanctions over Khashoggi,"Dubai (CNN Business) Shares in Saudi Arabia plunged as the fallout over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi got worse over the weekend.

The main stock market index in Riyadh fell as much as 7% on Sunday and billions of dollars were wiped off the value of leading Saudi companies. The index recovered some ground later to close 3.5% down.

Stocks have dropped as much as 9% since Khashoggi disappeared on October 2 after walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The losses wiped out all the market's gains in 2018, although it is still up 8% from a year ago.

For more than two years, the kingdom has been on an ambitious plan to modernize and diversify its economy away from oil. The plan, known as Vision 2030 and spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aims to increase foreign investment, boost tourism and grow the private sector.

According to a United Nations report earlier this year, direct foreign investment in Saudi Arabia fell to $1.4 billion in 2017, the lowest level in 14 years.

Still, the Saudi economy has been recovering from a recession and investors were encouraged earlier this year when index compiler MSCI granted the country emerging market status. That means that stocks traded in Saudi Arabia can now be included in broader funds, making it easier for investors around the world to put their money into the kingdom's economy.

But the unexplained disappearance of Khashoggi, a former Saudi government adviser turned critic, has already prompted some big-name business partners to cut ties with projects that are central to Saudi's plans of building a modern economy with technology at its core.

Turkish authorities claim to have evidence that Khashoggi, a US resident and columnist for the Washington Post, was murdered inside the consulate — an accusation the kingdom strenuously denies.

""What has reportedly happened in Turkey ... if proved true, would clearly change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi government,"" he said in a statement.

And a huge investment conference dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"", scheduled for later this month, has seen some leading speakers and participants drop out. Most international media partners have pulled their sponsorships

President Donald Trump has vowed that the United States will get to the bottom of what happened to Khashoggi, and has warned of ""severe punishment"" if he were found to have been killed in the consulate.

In a statement on Sunday , the kingdom said it rejected any threats of economic sanctions or political pressure and would retaliate accordingly.

""Markets start to price in a fundamental change in the nature of the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia,"" said Jaap Meijer, managing director and head of equity research at Arqaam Capital. ""We believe it is not warranted given the long term relationship between the two countries, and Saudi being the swing oil producer.""

Saudi Arabia has been pumping more oil into global markets to make up for a shortfall created by Trump's decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran.

The Saudi stock market sharply fell Sunday after President Donald Trump threatened ""severe punishment"" over the disappearance of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi.

There's now some doubt about whether US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will attend the Riyadh conference. At the closing press conference of the International Monetary Fund meeting in Bali, Indonesia, on Saturday he said he still planned on going.

But speaking later that day in the Oval Office, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would not confirm that Mnuchin would attending the Future Investment Initiative.

""I think we need to continue to evaluate the facts and we'll make that decision,"" he said.

The BBC reported on Sunday morning that UK Trade Secretary Liam Fox may also pull out."
Tell us what you think: What will spark the next big market move?,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all capped their worst weekly performance since March on Friday, despite seeing strong gains for the day. The moves on Wall Street came amid a global market sell-off for the week.

Meanwhile, the earnings season is underway in the U.S., and financial giant J.P. Morgan reported Friday that third-quarter figures beat analysts' expectations.

At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump has been vocal in his criticism of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, even attributing last week's partial meltdown in stocks to the U.S. central bank and saying it has ""gone crazy.""

Also last week, fresh data showed that China's trade surplus with the U.S. widened to a record $34.13 billion in September. All this comes as the ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing drags on.

On Sunday, China's central bank governor said it still has ""plenty"" of tools to counter any downside from the trade tensions."
"Asia markets: Wall Street, US-China trade war, currencies in focus","Stocks in Asia slipped on Monday afternoon as investors remained cautious, following global losses in the previous week.

The moves in China came as new reserve requirements for lenders went into effect, in a move by the People's Bank of China which is expected to inject 750 billion yuan (around $108.4 billion) into the banking system.

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 fell by 1.87 percent to close at 22,271.30, while the Topix index slipped by 1.59 percent at 1,675.44, with most sectors ending the trading day lower.

Bear or bull? Five reasons to claw or thunder,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A sharp pullback in stocks last week, including the S&P 500's .SPX biggest single-day drop since a market correction in February, has left investors questioning whether this could signal danger for the longest-ever bull run for U.S. equities.

The following are five arguments on either side of the debate:

REASONS TO BE BULLISH

PROFITS, PROFITS, PROFITS: Strong growth in U.S. corporate profits underpins the case for the bull market continuing its run. S&P 500 earnings are expected to rise 23.1 percent this year, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.

“If you still think the corporate profit story is intact, you should be owning stocks here,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.

IT’S THE ECONOMY, STUPID: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week said the outlook for the U.S. economy is “remarkably positive,” and strategists are quick to note that it is rare to have a bear market when the economy is expanding.

“When you don’t have a recession, typically pullbacks can be sharp, but they tend to be short,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts.

HIGHER INTEREST RATES - NO BIG DEAL: The spike in U.S. Treasury yields spooked stocks but rising rates are less concerning if they are gradual.

“We believe we are in a reflationary environment ... and hence, rising rates tend to be associated with rising stock prices,” Thomas Lee, Fundstrat’s head of research, said in a note.

MARKET CORRECTIONS - THEY’RE A GOOD THING: Sharp market pull-backs are viewed positively in the context of a long bull run because they rid the market of complacent investors and shake off pricey valuations.

“You need these periodic cleanses to kind of refresh and then allow the market to move higher,” Carlson said.

THE BUYBACK IS YOUR FRIEND: Some market-watchers have pointed to a recent “quiet period” preventing corporate stock buybacks as a potential reason for a lack of support during the volatility. But companies are expected to keep using their cash to repurchase their stock, keeping demand for equities high. Goldman Sachs strategists expect S&P 500 buybacks to climb by 22 percent to $940 billion in 2019.

Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management, said that buybacks are “sustainable:” “You’ve got companies generating a higher level of cash flow based on the tax cuts that are in effect now, and that cash flow has to go somewhere.”

REASONS TO BE BEARISH:

EARNINGS - SHAKIER THAN THEY SEEM: After this year’s tax-fueled boost, S&P 500 earnings growth is expected to step down to 10 percent in 2019. Some investors worry that even that rate may be too high, given pressures from rising wages and other increasing costs.

“The bull case is predicated on earnings being OK and if we actually see earnings estimates roll down ... that’s a big risk,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist with SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.

THE FED DOES NOT HAVE YOUR BACK: Powell’s recent comments that rates need to continue to move toward an estimated neutral level and even a bit beyond are a concern for investors who believe the central bank may increase rates too quickly.

“The Fed could tighten too much, especially given that it is using two tools at the same time - rate hikes and balance sheet normalization,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That has the potential to choke economic growth and create disruption and volatility in the stock market.”

POLITICS - CLOUDS ON THE HORIZON: Investors point to risks from increasing tensions over trade between the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies.

“The growing tariff wars have the potential to negatively impact economic growth,” Hooper said.

Turmoil in Washington also creates unease on Wall Street, and volatility could rise ahead of the November congressional elections.

BONDS ARE ENTICING: Key to the run in stocks has been their relative yield advantage over other assets, namely bonds. But the rise in bond yields means they are increasingly attractive and may start to lure away investor resources from stocks.

“If bond yields start offering competition to equities, then the favorable case for equities versus bonds is adversely affected and that is the key thing to watch out for,” said Vinay Pande, head of short-term investment opportunities at UBS Global Wealth Management.

TECH WRECK: Shares of technology and other Internet-related companies have led the stock market’s ascent to record highs in recent years, but those shares have particularly suffered in the recent pullback.

If tech continues to stumble, some investors are concerned that other sectors will fail to pick up the slack in any market rotation."

Safe havens rise on West-Saudi tension; world stocks fall,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major stock markets slipped on Monday as rising tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia added to concerns over the pace of global economic growth, with investors flocking to traditional safe-havens like the Japanese and Swiss currencies, as well as gold.

Oil prices rose as the Saudi-West rift more than offset concerns over slowing demand for oil in the long term.

The yen JPY= touched a one-month high versus the greenback and the Swiss franc CHF= rose for the fourth session in five while gold XAU= hit its highest since late July.

Saudi Arabia’s King Salman on Monday ordered an internal probe into the unexplained disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi as a joint Turkish-Saudi team was expected at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where the journalist and dissident was last seen on Oct. 2.

The kingdom is preparing a report that would admit Khashoggi was killed as the result of an interrogation that went wrong, CNN reported, citing two unnamed sources.

Turkish police have audio showing Khashoggi was killed at the consulate, sources told Reuters.

Over the weekend, prominent business people including JPMorgan’s (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon and Ford (F.N) Chairman Bill Ford canceled plans to attend an investor conference this month in Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter.

U.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.48 percent to $71.68 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $80.76, up 0.41 percent on the day.

“If the Saudis don’t come to the rescue when the Iranian sanctions kick in... it’s going to be a very under-supplied market. That was the fear that was initially driving prices higher,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.

On Wall Street, major indexes were mixed, with defensive sector stocks rising after soft retail sales data. Apple (AAPL.O) was among the largest drags after a warning from Goldman Sachs regarding overall consumer demand from China.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 89.44 points, or 0.35 percent, to 25,250.55, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 16.34 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,750.79 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 66.15 points, or 0.88 percent, to 7,430.74.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.20 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.45 percent.

Emerging market stocks lost 0.86 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 1.11 percent lower.

Japan's Nikkei .N225 slumped 1.9 percent. Washington said it would seek a provision about currency manipulation in future trade deals with Japan.
