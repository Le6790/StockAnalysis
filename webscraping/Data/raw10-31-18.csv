"Stocks surge to cap off wild October, but S&P 500 posts biggest monthly loss since 2011","Is the nightmare on Wall Street finally coming to an end? 5:25 PM ET Wed, 31 Oct 2018 | 06:37

Stocks rose sharply on Wednesday for a second straight day as strong earnings from General Motors and Facebook lifted sentiment. But the major averages still posted big October losses.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 241.12 points to 25,115.76, led by Visa, bringing its two-day gain to about 650 points. The S&P 500 gained 1.1 percent to 2,711.68 as consumer discretionary and energy outperformed. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2 percent to 7,305.90 and briefly climbed out of correction territory.

Still, the major averages posted big losses for the month:

The S&P 500 lost 6.9 percent in October, its biggest one-month slide since September 2011, when it fell 7.2 percent.

The Dow dropped 5.1 percent to post its biggest monthly fall since January 2016, when it dropped 5.5 percent.

The Nasdaq plunged 9.2 percent, its largest monthly pullback since November 2008, when it shed 10.8 percent.

""The earnings story is flip-flopping between being very good and pretty good,"" said Craig Birk, CIO at Personal Capital. ""There's also some optimism that a breakthrough on trade could happen.""

""The drop this month came out of nowhere. Usually that's a sign of a correction and not a bear market,"" he said. ""Usually a bear market rolls more slowly.""

General Motors shares spiked 9.1 percent after the company reported quarterly results that easily topped expectations. The company said it sold fewer cars in the third quarter, but at a higher price, boosting its bottom line.

Facebook shares rose 3.8 percent after the company reported on Tuesday better-than-expected earnings. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's earnings call Facebook plans to invest significantly in its business next year. He also said Facebook plans to build products such as Facebook Watch and Instagram TV.

The stock's rise on Wednesday led Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet higher.

Equities have been under pressure this month amid renewed concern over rising interest rates and U.S.-China trade relations, as well as worries about slowing corporate earnings growth. Tech shares have also taken a big hit, adding pressure to the broader indexes. Facebook's gains Wednesday helped ease these losses, but the sector still fell more than 8 percent for October."
Stocks end an ugly October on an up note as S&P 500 suffers biggest monthly fall in 7 years,"IStockphoto Facebook shares are on the move.

Stocks climbed Wednesday to close out an ugly October on a positive note as solid earnings from high-profile brands cheered investors and revived strong buying interest in equities.

However, main benchmarks were not able to avoid recording sizeable losses for the month, leaving doubt as to whether the rally heralded a more permanent attitude in the market or if it was more of a short-term reaction to decent quarterly results.

How did benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.79% gained 241.12 points, or 1%, to 25,115.76, the first time for the blue chip index to finish above 25,000 since Oct. 23.

The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.82% advanced 29.05 points, or 1.1%, to 2,711.68, climbing for two days in a row, something it had not done since its three-day winning streak that ended on Sept. 20.

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% rose 144.25 points, or 2%, to 7,305.90.

For October, the S&P 500 shed 6.9% for its biggest monthly decline since September 2011, while the Dow dropped 5.1% in its biggest monthly percentage fall since January 2016. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the worst-performing major benchmark, dropping 9.2% in October for the biggest fall since November 2008.

What drove the market?

Facebook’s quarterly results may have provided some optimism after the social-media giant delivered a report that wasn’t as scary as Wall Street feared. That is notable because so-called FAANG names, an acronym of technology and internet-related stocks, among which Facebook is a member, have been at the heart of stock gains over the past 18 months. The other members of the group include Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Apple Inc., and Google-parent Alphabet Inc., which have all seen their shares bludgeoned over the past few weeks amid doubts about the ability of these companies to consistently produce earnings growth, while managing user security.

Stock markets globally were also bouncing back, signaling a pivot from a risk-off mode that had gripped much of the investing world during a volatile month that has left the Nasdaq in correction territory, defined as a drop of at least 10% from a recent peak, with the Dow and S&P 500 points, at one point, flirting with tumbling into correction for the second time in 2018.

Fears of trade wars, a policy misstep by the Federal Reserve as the central bank attempts to normalize monetary policy from crisis-era levels and worries about contracting growth outside of the U.S. have been key elements of a erosion of confidence among investors.

The Bank of Japan kept its ultra-easy monetary policy in place as concerns grow about the impact of U.S.-China trade tensions on the Japanese economy, but did warn of the adverse impact of protectionism and the U.K.’s efforts to exit from the European Union on global markets and economies.

Meanwhile, China’s manufacturing and services PMI data for October showed the slowest growth in activity in over two years, coming in at 50.2 from 50.8 in September, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. A reading of at least 50 indicates improving conditions. The report provides further evidence of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

What data were in focus?

Private-sector employers added 227,000 new jobs in October, according to payroll firm Automatic Data Processing, above expectations for 202,000 new jobs.

Labor costs rose 0.8% in the third quarter, according to the Labor Department’s employment cost index report, topping the consensus forecast for a 0.7% jump. Year-over-year, compensation growth remained at the 2.8% level seen in the second quarter, a 10-year high.

Chicago-area PMI came in at 58.4, down from 60.4 and below the consensus estimate of 60.0, according to FactSet. While a reading above 50 indicates expanding activity, this was the lowest reading of the index since April.

What were analysts saying?

“We’ve been trading on things that aren’t fundamental in nature, and now we’re back to looking at the fundamentals, which are very attractive,” Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, told MarketWatch.

Schutte pointed to Wednesday’s employment-cost index release as evidence that wage growth is accelerating while inflation remains moderate. “We’re hiring more people and we’re paying them more, and that’s great news for the economy,” he said.

Tom Essaye, president of the Sevens Report, said in a note to clients that recent gains show that the “shock of last week’s earnings disappointment is behind us,” and that investors are realizing the market is undersold.

“For now, we remain in the bottoming process, although barring any deterioration in the [macro outlook], I don’t expect a continued waterfall decline,” he said.

What stocks were in focus?

Shares of Facebook FB, +1.39% rose 3.8% after the company beat third-quarter profit forecasts, while continuing to warn investors that costs would rise.

General Motors Co. GM, +3.24% shares jumped 9.1% after third-quarter earnings and revenue came in above expectations.

Shares of Clorox Co. CLX, -0.26% declined 2.9% after the consumer products company lowered its profit outlook for 2019, though it did beat profit and revenue expectations for the third quarter of 2018.

Estée Lauder Cos.’s stock EL, +0.82% climbed 4.7% after the beauty products company approved a buyback and lifted its quarterly dividend.

Shares of eBay Inc. EBAY, +1.12% surged 5.9% following earnings that met analysts’ expectations. However, the stock is down more than 27% year-to-date.

Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +0.26% fell 0.5% after Bank of America downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral.”

Shares of Arconic Inc. ARNC, +0.66% rose 3.2% after Reuters reported that private-equity firm Apollo Global Management would acquire the aluminum products manufacturer.

Yum Brands Inc. YUM, +0.39% advanced 4.6%, following a Wednesday morning earnings report that surpassed analyst expectations.

Baxter International Inc. BAX, +1.06% stock tumbled 9% after the company released third-quarter earnings.

Kellogg Co. K, +1.53% shares skidded 8.9% after the cereal company reported lower revenue in the third quarter.

Shares of T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS, -0.33% popped 7.2% following quarterly earnings that showed a surge in new customers.

How were other markets trading?

Asian markets finished the day higher, with the Nikkei NIK, +0.40% up more than 2% and European stocks are also rose.

Oil futures US:CLZ8 were weaker, while gold prices GCZ8, -0.16% settled lower, and the ICE dollar index DXY, +0.42% traded mostly flat.

Dow Gains 106 Points as Facebook’s Stock Cheers the Market,"Michael Haddad

Text size

6:19 a.m. A little Facebook (FB) goes a long way for the market.

Shares of the social-media giant were up more than 3% on Wednesday morning after it reported earnings after Tuesday’s close, and you can see its impact in early trading. Futures on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have gained 0.8%, while S&P 500 futures have risen 0.5%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures have advanced 106 points, or 0.4%."
Why a 240-point rally for the Dow and stock-market rebound is ‘uninspiring’,"Technical analyst Jeff deGraaf is unimpressed with the current attempt by stocks to punch higher after a sharp rally on Tuesday an apparent follow through in early Wednesday action.

The chairman of research firm Renaissance Macro Research suggests that a lack of real volume and breadth, or more sectors getting involved in the recent turn higher, has left him wanting more after a withering October for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.82% the Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, +0.79% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79%

“A sigh of relief fell over the street as the losing streak for equities abated near support at 2600 on the SPX. We’d classify the rebound as ‘uninspiring’ where TRIN was a useless .61 and breadth a mediocre 2.2:1,” he wrote in a Wednesday research note. TRIN refers to a short-term technical trading indicator, developed by the late Richard Arms in the 1970s, that tracks volume in advancing and declining stocks.

Echoing comments made by other technical analysts that include Ralph Acampora, deGraaf makes the case that enough destruction in the market has been done to warrant a more substantive and consistent move higher for equity markets.

The Nasdaq, which fell into correction last week, defined as a drop of at least 10% from a recent peak, is on track for its biggest monthly decline since October 2008. Moreover, nearly all of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors are on track for their worst monthly declines since 2008, according to Dow Jones Data Group (see table below).

“This is important because we’ve seen enough deterioration in our trend work to raise the bar on what’s needed to reach escape velocity and shift the burden back to the bears,” wrote deGraaf.

“These are bounces in terrible trends, and are high probability failures in the near-term, but whether days or weeks is hard to say,” he said. The analyst sees support for the S&P 500 at around the 2,600 level.

On Wednesday, stocks enjoyed a strong two-day rally after upbeat private-sector employment data from Automatic Data Processing. The stock market has been under pressure amid myriad worries. Those include a policy misstep by the Federal Reserve, anxieties about rising interest rates and a slowdown in economic expansion outside of the U.S."
Here's why you should be hopeful about stocks in November,"New York (CNN Business) After a scary October, the stock market could have a winning November.

The Nasdaq's gains Wednesday trimmed its monthly decline to 9.2% — still the index's worst month since November 2008. The S&P 500 ended the month down 6.8%, its steepest decline since September 2011.

Expect stocks to get back on track following this month's pullback, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist for BMO Capital Markets, said Wednesday on CNN's ""Markets Now"" live show.

Belski described the dip as ""very normal and very healthy.""

"After a 673-point, 2-day surge for the Dow, is the worst over for the stock market?","It’s Wall Street’s version of an inquiry that might be fielded by a parent on a long car trip: Are we there yet?

In this case, the there refers to the bottom of a stock market that had seen year-to-date gains for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.79% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.82% briefly erased this week and pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% into a correction, usually defined as a drop of at least 10% from a recent high, for the first time in about two years.

Presently, there isn’t a consensus for what lies ahead for U.S. equities, which had been punished in an October that had proved to be as painful as historical statistics foretold.

However, Wednesday’s action, a spillover from Tuesday’s rally, might imply that the market may be out of the woods. The Dow was trading up by more than 400 points at the intraday peak, while the S&P 500 was in ascendancy, and the Nasdaq was powering higher as well (and out of correction, if you are an avid CNBC watcher, even if that isn’t possible).

Upbeat quarterly results from Facebook Inc. FB, +1.39% which put aside fear of further woes in so-called FANG names, which have been key to the overall markets stretch of repeated all-time highs, and strong private-sector labor-market data have helped to support a buying mood — for now.

So, here’s a brief rundown of the bull and bear cases for the next phase of the market.

The bull case

Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, in a Wednesday research note said one reason for the two-day rally that is under way is conditions in the market that had placed many of the stocks on U.S. exchanges in oversold positions. “This makes sense — we are massively oversold. A 10% decline in 20 days is a 2 standard deviation event,” he wrote.

Lee pointed to a number of so-called oversold conditions that have prevailed amid this October selloff, including breaches below the closely followed moving averages at 50 days and 200 days. However, he has recommended that investors should be buying — aggressively at this point.

“The prevalence of these 4 oversold conditions (50D/200D for S&P 500/Russell 2000) is a major tactical signal and we would be aggressive buyers.”

Lee said he sees the market rallying 10% or better by the end of 2018.

Similarly, Tom McClellan, publisher of the McClellan Market Report and a high-profile chart technician, told MarketWatch that the recent downdraft has been a function of seasonal volatility associated with October and not a more significant upending of a 10-year bull market. He also said he views stocks as oversold and said he remains bullish on the stock-market outlook.

Another bull, DWS’s chief investment officer, David Bianco, said that markets corrected because investors had reassessed equity valuations and earnings expectations. “Why the correction? Investors reset 2019 S&P EPS growth from 10% to 5%,” Bianco wrote in a Tuesday research note. He said corrections usually are caused by recessions, and he doesn’t see one of those in the cards. “When corrections aren’t followed by recessions, the average S&P gain six months later is 18.5%, since 1957,” he wrote.

The bear case

MarketWatch has outlined the case for why things could get worse before they get better, at least in the near term. But to recap, a number of chart watchers say that more work needs to be done to repair the downturn that began in early October before their faith is restored in the bull-market run.

Jeff deGraaf, chairman of research firm Renaissance Macro Research, said he wants to see better market breadth and volume. “A sigh of relief fell over the [S]treet as the losing streak for equities abated near support at 2,600 on the SPX. We’d classify the rebound as ‘uninspiring,’ ” he said, referencing specifically Tuesday’s drive higher.

A prominent technical analyst, Ralph Acampora, appeared to agree with DeGraaf and to believe that sufficient destruction was done to the market to warrant a better and more consistent turn higher.

Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, in a Wednesday afternoon note said that this two-day rally merits caution: “The scale of this week’s stock market move (the S&P 500 is 5% above its late-Monday low) is more a function of the volatility seen in October than evidence, at this point, of improving trends.”

“While index-level strength off of Monday’s lows is encouraging, we maintain a cautious view. We can use historical tendencies to describe a likely path forward. At the same time, we cannot be so beholden to these expectations that we turn a blind eye to emerging realities,” he wrote.

As always, however, only time will tell how things ultimately play out. But it would appear sure to be a bumpy ride with the midterm elections ahead, more rate increases expected from the Federal Reserve and nagging questions about the health of the global economy. In other words, all factors that helped to drive this market lower in the first place.

Dow Jones Futures Signal A Stock Market Correction First; Facebook Stock Jumps,"Dow Jones futures rose strongly Wednesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, signaling the major averages may mount their first back-to-back gains in October's stock market correction. Facebook (FB), Electronic Arts (EA), FireEye (FEYE), iQiyi (IQ) and Paycom Software (PAYC) were notable tech companies moving on late Tuesday earnings.

X

Facebook stock initially wavered late, but moved higher on positive Q4 comments. FireEye stock was a clear winner, while Electronic Arts, iQiyi (IQ) and Paycom were losers late.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures climbed 0.8% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures were up 1.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular session. That's been particularly true in October's stock market correction, with big swings during normal and extended trading hours.

The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite had another volatile session Tuesday, but closed up 1.6% to 1.8%. But one day does not end a stock market correction. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite have yet to have back-to-back gains in October. The Dow hasn't done so since the first few days of the month.

Tuesday is the first day in a new rally attempt. Wait to see if one or more of the major averages can confirm a new uptrend via a follow-through day, starting with the fourth day of a rally attempt. Right now that would be Friday.

Facebook Earnings

Facebook earnings rose 11% to $1.76 a share. Revenue climbed about 33% to $13.539 billion.

Analysts expected Facebook earnings to fall 8% to $1.47 a share, with revenue rising 33% to $13.781 billion.

Monthly active users were at 2.27 billion at the end of Q3, up 10% vs. a year earlier but below some estimates.

On the Facebook earnings conference call, the social giant forecast that Q4 revenue growth will decelerate by a mid- to high-single-digit number, a little less than its prior prediction for a high-single-digit slowdown. Facebook also sees Q4 expenses and capital spending rising less than it expected in its Q2 earnings call. The company also eased concerns about 2019 costs.

Instagram will continue to be a focus. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also said Facebook will emphasize video and Facebook Stories for the future vs. its news feed.

Facebook stock was up and down initially but moved decisively higher after the Q4 guidance. Shares rallied 5.7% early Wednesday.

Facebook stock plunged after the Q2 earnings report, hitting an 18-month low of 139.03 intraday on Monday. Shares did rebound 2.9% to 146.22 in Tuesday's stock market trading.

Electronic Arts Earnings

Electronic Arts earnings rose 34% to 83 cents a share for its fiscal Q2, with revenue up 3% to $1.22 billion.

Wall Street forecast Electronic Arts earnings per share of 58 cents, down 8% vs. a year earlier, with flat revenue of $1.183 billion.

But Electronic Arts guided net bookings in the holiday Q3 at $1.73 billion, well below some estimates.

EA shares fell 3.4% before the open. Electronic Arts stock closed up 3.6% Tuesday. But shares have sold off sharply since peaking in July, tumbling to an 18-month low on Monday.

iQiyi Earnings

Often called the ""Netflix of China,"" iQiyi actually licenses Netflix (NFLX) content in China. It is majority-owned by Baidu (BIDU).

IQiyi lost 63 cents a share, missing views by 25 cents. Revenue rose 48% to $1 billion, in line. IQiyi sees Q4 net revenue of 6.48 billion to 6.75 billion yuan, or $943.5 million to $982.8 million. That's below estimates.

iQiyi stock tumbled 8.4% early, off overnight lows. On Tuesday, shares rose 3.9% to 22.20 after hitting a five-month low intraday.

The iQiyi IPO launched in late March at 18 a share, tumbling to 15.55 in its debut. But it soon surged higher, running up to 46.23 on June 19. Since then shares have steadily fallen.

Its parent, Chinese search giant Baidu, reported a smaller-than-expected earnings drop and topped revenue views. Baidu stock edged higher.

Paycom Earnings

Paycom earnings soared 79% to 52 cents a share. Revenue leapt nearly 32% to $133.29 million.

Analysts expected Paycom earnings to advance 76% to 51 cents a share, with revenue rising 29% to $130.2 million.

Paycom sees Q4 revenue at $142.5 million to $144.5 million. Analysts expected $142.4 million. But Paycom saw adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at a midpoint of $50.5 million, below views for $51.4 million.

Paycom stock slid 3.2% early. Shares have sold off since mid-September, falling through the 50-day line early this month. Paycom stock has been trying to consolidate above its 200-day line recently, but rebounded 4.7% Tuesday.

FireEye Earnings

FireEye earnings came in at 6 cents a share adjusted, reversing a year-earlier 4-cent loss. Revenue rose 7% to $211.65 million.

Analysts expected FireEye earnings of 2 cents a share, with revenue at $208.5 million.

FireEye sees Q4 EPS at 5 cents, a penny above views.

FireEye stock rose 5.8% before the open. Shares tried to break out from a cup-with-handle base with a 17.94 buy point on Oct. 17, but failed to close above that level. On Monday, FireEye stock fell below its 50-day and 200-day lines, sinking enough to invalidate the entry point. Shares rallied 2.7% to 16.85 Tuesday, reclaiming both averages.

Fireye has a new handle buy point at 18.16.

Stocks rally to avoid their worst month since the financial crisis,"REUTERS/Brendan McDermid

Stocks rose Wednesday as Wall Street seemed to shake off fears about rising rates and signs of slowing growth.

After a string of sharp sell-offs in recent weeks, the US indexes had been headed toward their worst month since the financial crisis.

Follow the US indexes in real time here.

Stocks jumped Wednesday as an earnings-fueled rally helped stave concerns about signs of slowing growth and rising rates, allowing Wall Street to sidestep what would have marked its worst month since the financial crisis.

The S&P 500 gained 1.08%, but still recorded its worst month since 2011. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.97%, or nearly 250 points, and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 2%. The S&P 500 would have needed to finish the month down more than 8.2% to suffer its biggest monthly decline since May 2009.

Following a bruising few weeks, earnings season helped technology stocks make a comeback.

Facebook posted revenue and guidance that came in slightly below estimates, but Wall Street seemed relieved users hadn't fled during a quarter punctuated by scandal. General Motors beat, dodging some trade-war issues that have cast uncertainty on the auto industry. Apple, Spotify, and Starbucks are expected to report after the bell Thursday.

Oppenheimer Research chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus said the third-quarter earnings have appeared impressive overall, with more than half of S&P 500 companies having reported. But he added that concerns about forward guidance have continued.

""A key problem is that projections of the outcome to a trade war tend toward the darker side of things,"" Stoltzfus said. ""Businesses in the US and China are not shy about expressing their concerns about the risks to revenues and earnings should the trade war become protracted.""

In the latest sign of a tightening labor market, data before the US open showed companies added the most jobs in eight months in October. The private sector added 227,000 jobs in October, the ADP Research Institute said, compared with economist forecasts for 189,000. The Labor Department is scheduled to release its employment report Friday.

Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it isn't clear what ADP estimates will mean for the Labor Department report because they likely won't capture hits from Hurricane Michael, while the official data will.

""We'd be very surprised to see Friday's headlines as strong as the ADP data, but with hurricanes making landfall in the survey weeks in both September and August — that has never happened before, as far as we know — we're braced for anything,"" Sheperdson said.

Wall Street has mirrored gloomy markets around the world in recent weeks, with global equities also recording their worst October in years.

China's government said Wednesday that manufacturing growth was the slowest in more than two years this month. The manufacturing PMI reading came in at 50.2 in October, only slightly surpassing the threshold that indicates expansion. A reading below 50 indicates contraction."
