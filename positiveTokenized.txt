it had also fallen for eight straight weeks We basically saw a crash and so youre going to see a big bounce off that he said That bounce was predicated by the days news with investors breathing a sigh

market really put in a bottom on Friday Johnson said hes not convinced He equated Mondays rally to a beach ball that has been pushed further and further under the water where it builds up so much pressure that when it is finally released it bounces We saw a lot of desperate selling over the last few weeks and at some point these stocks start to look attractive Christopher Colarik portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment Management Previous efforts to get the credit markets moving again had failed to reassure investors but the latest developments seemed to provide reassurance Seeing that

ended the day higher than it began Nine hundred and thirtysix points higher to be exact making for the biggest singleday percentage gain in 75 years The surge came as governments and central banks around the world mounted an aggressive coordinated campaign to unlock the global flow of credit an effort that investors said they had been waiting for Some experts greeted the rally as a turning point in the slowmotion crash that has erased five years worth of value from the stock market in the last few weeks When Monday began shares of some bluechip companies were at their cheapest levels in years “ The market clearly was getting priced for an Armageddon a depression for the end of Western civilization as we know it ” said Edward Yardeni the investment strategist “ A lot of people

investors jumped in to buy than were selling last week Portions of the credit markets — which remained locked tight before the weekend — were closed for the Columbus Day holiday so investors may have had trouble gauging the reaction among banks and big lenders to the new global initiatives Some analysts said that stock investors held off on their trades to see how the credit markets would react “
