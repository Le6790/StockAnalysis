Stocks Stabilize After Plummeting Earlier this Month,"Stocks have been under pressure since the beginning of October, but there are some signs of stabilization. According to FactSet's ""Earnings Insight,"" early S&P 500 third quarter earnings have shown a blended 19.1% growth rate. The growth rate would be the highest since Q1 2011 – if it continues for the remaining 94% of S&P 500 companies – and help moderate forward price-earnings ratios to 15.7x, which is below their five-year average.

Economic data has also been stronger than expected. Last month, industrial production grew at a 0.3% pace – surpassing a consensus forecast of just 0.2%. When adding back inflation, there has been strong 6% growth in the manufacturing sector. The Federal Reserve suggested that one more rate hike is in the cards this year, along with three more gradual rate hikes to follow next year, but bond yields stabilized last week.

Next week, traders will be watching several key economic indicators, including the Beige Book and new home sales on Oct. 24, jobless claims on Oct. 25, and GDP and consumer sentiment data on Oct. 26. New home sales could be especially in focus given the weak existing home sales data last week.

S&P 500 Regains Some Ground

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) edged 0.25% higher last week. After forming a double top in late September and early October, the index fell sharply lower to trendline support and its 200-day moving average. Traders should watch for a rebound from these levels to retest S2 support at $281.98 or a breakdown to prior lows at around $260.00. Looking at technical indicators, the relative strength index (RSI) appears slightly oversold at 36.23, but the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) remains in a strong bearish downtrend, suggesting further downside ahead.

Industrials Outperform

The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) rose 0.55% last week, making it the best performing major index. After briefly hitting R1 resistance two weeks ago, the index moved sharply lower to the 200-day moving average before rebounding last week. Traders should watch for a further rebound above S1 support and the 50-day moving average at $259.41 to the pivot point at $262.94, or a breakdown to retest the 200-day moving average. The RSI appears relatively neutral, but the MACD remains in a strong bearish downtrend.

Tech Stocks Give Up Gains

The PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) fell 0.4% last week, making it the worst performing major index. After briefly recovering to S2 support two weeks ago, the index fell sharply last week. Traders should watch for a breakout from S2 support to the 50-day moving average on the upside or a breakdown from the 200-day moving average to trendline support on the downside. Looking at technical indicators, the RSI appears slightly oversold at 38.71, but the MACD remains in a bearish downtrend.

Small Caps Continue to Fall

The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) fell 0.04% last week. Since breaking down from key trendline support at the beginning of the month, the index has experienced a steady decline to prior lows of around $152.00. Traders should watch for a rebound from these levels to the 200-day moving average at $160.28, or a breakdown from trendline support to fresh lows. The RSI appears oversold with a reading of 28.63, but the MACD remains in its long-term decline that began in early September.

"Investors, don't lose sleep over the midterm elections","The early October jolt of stock market volatility seemed to awaken investors briefly from a relative sense of calm and reminded us that pullbacks and downside risk are part of the price to be paid for upside performance.

Despite just about every investing fear imaginable, any long-term snapshot of stock market performance will illustrate a persistent bias toward positive performance. Whether looking back 10, 50, 100 years or more, the basic economics of investing in a broad range of publicly traded companies is difficult to deny.

Of course, we also know that looking at the 100-year ascent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average provides little comfort to somebody who is watching their retirement savings drop by 3% or more in a single day.

On the subject of whether more market shake-ups are ahead, most financial advisers are rightly positioning the possible impact of the midterm elections along the lines of: ""We're long-term investors"" or ""We don't have a crystal ball.""

And considering the markets' nonreaction to the unexpected election of President Donald J. Trump, maybe there is something to be said for not worrying about it.

But if that won't suffice, just consider how three possible midterm election scenarios could affect the markets.

The most likely scenario shifts control of the House of Representatives from Republicans to Democrats.

Because this is considered most likely, it is the outcome that would be the least jarring to the financial markets initially.

Long term, a divided government usually means little gets done legislatively.

If the Democrats gain control of both houses of Congress or the Republicans retain control, the long-term outlook either takes the shape of uber-gridlock or more of the same, legislatively speaking.

In terms of market impact, consider that since 1949, the third quarter of a midterm election year has averaged the second-worst performance of the 16 quarters making up a four-year presidential term.

The S&P 500 Index averaged a gain of 0.1% during those quarters. The worst quarter in the cycle is the second quarter of a midterm year, averaging -2.8%.

In other words, the worst is behind us, historically speaking.

The good news is the fourth quarter of a midterm election year has averaged a gain of 8%, and the first quarter of the following year has averaged a gain of 7.5%.

Of course, we all know past performance is no guarantee ...

But beyond any anticipated reactions from financial markets, there is the pragmatic reality of how the election outcome will affect the financial services industry.

As InvestmentNews senior reporter Mark Schoeff Jr. laid out in last week's cover story, if Democrats take control of the House, that could alter the course for such major issues as the Securities and Exchange Commission's proposed advice rule, additional tax reform and retirement savings.

Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, and the ranking members of other committees showed their hand in a Sept. 12 letter to SEC chairman Jay Clayton. The letter criticized the agency's Regulation Best Interest as too weak.

Mark also reported on Democratic opposition to further tax cuts in the vein of those already passed, and the potential positive effect on retirement savings policies. If Democrats take the house, expect Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., to become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. He is a vocal advocate of measures that encourage Americans to save more for retirement.

As is often the case, there is much at stake, which is why we vote.

But what should not be keeping investors awake at night is how whatever happens on Nov. 6 could disrupt a solid, long-term investing strategy."
Economic Highs and Lows in New York City (in Photos),"There are few other places where the wealth gap is so visible.

The gap in personal wealth between the richest and the poorest people is starker in New York than almost anywhere else in America. That inequality was once again on display this week: Famed auction house Sotheby's put Marie Antoinette's jewels up for display and the Dow Jones index surged up and down through the week, alternately disappointing and delighting traders. Meanwhile, nearly one in four children in the city didn't have enough to eat, and one in 10 public school students were homeless.
