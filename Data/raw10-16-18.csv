"Dow jumps more than 500 points, posts best day since March as earnings fuel rally","Why you shouldn't panic when stocks are getting slammed 9:47 AM ET Fri, 12 Oct 2018 | 02:11

Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital, said more companies should report stronger-than-expected earnings moving forward. ""We were overly worried about the economy at the start of October,"" Forrest said. ""I think the bar has been set pretty low by sell-side analysts.""

Investors turned their eyes to Netflix after the close on Tuesday, as the company released its quarterly results. The company's earnings easily beat analyst expectations and sent Netflix shares up more than 14 percent in after-hours trading.

Investors came into the earnings season with high hopes. Analysts polled by FactSet expect third-quarter S&P 500 earnings to have grown by 19 percent.

However, Dow-component Walmart slashed its fiscal 2019 earnings forecast on Tuesday, citing its Flipkart acquisition. The earnings season comes as Wall Street tries to recover from sharp losses seen last week.

The Dow and S&P 500 fell more than 4 percent last week as worries over higher borrowing costs sent equities tumbling. The Nasdaq also fell 3.7 percent last week as tech shares dropped broadly.

But Bill Nygren, portfolio manager and chief investment officer at Harris Associates, said these worries about higher rates are misplaced.

""Over the past 50 years the 10-year bond has averaged about 6 percent and it's at about 3 percent today,"" Nygren told CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Tuesday. ""This concern about the jiggles in the 10-year rate going up 20 or 30 basis points I think is disconnected from 50 years of history of living with a bond [yield] that was much, much higher than it is today.""

Tuesday's moves come after fell in the previous session, led by tech, continuing from their overall trend last week. The S&P 500 slipped by 0.6 percent to close at 2,750.79 while the Nasdaq composite fell by 0.9 percent to end the trading day stateside at 7,430.74. The Dow also shed 89.44 points to close at 25,250.55."
Dow soars as investors cheer fat corporate profits,"The Dow soared 548 points , or 2.2%, on Tuesday as investors cheered fat profits from major companies and relative calm in the bond market. The huge rally, the Dow's best day since March, helped the index recover a chunk of last week's hefty losses

Tech stocks, the biggest losers during the market turmoil , raced back to life. The Nasdaq spiked nearly 3%, while the S&P 500 advanced 2.2%.

Investors piled back into tech darlings. Amazon, Facebook and Netflix closed sharply higher.

""It's a bounce back after an overdone situation last week,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.

Market sentiment was lifted by earnings beats from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Johnson & Johnson. Adobe and UnitedHealth added to the good news by offering upbeat guidance for 2019.

Taken together, the corporate report cards underscore the ability of businesses to cash in on the strong US economy. And the results should ease fears about the US-China trade war.

""We're focusing back on fundamentals,"" said Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors. Suzuki called Tuesday's rally a ""reflexive rebound.""

Last week, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all suffered their worst week since March . At one point, the Dow plummeted more than 1,000 points in just two trading days.

Despite Tuesday's advance, all three major indexes remain firmly in the red for the month.

One major source of investor nervousness has improved: bond yields. A sudden spike in 10-year Treasury rates above 3.25% spooked markets. The rapid climb in rates was driven by the strong economy, the surging federal deficit and concerns about a more aggressive Federal Reserve.

Investors feared higher borrowing costs that could slow growth and sudden competition for the stock market from boring bonds.

But Treasury rates, which move in the opposite direction of prices, eased late last week as investors poured cash into the safety of government bonds. Rates have stabilized at around 3.15%, relieving stock market bulls.

""That has reassured people that this is not the start of something much worse that could really sidetrack the market,"" said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank."
7 Titans of the Dow Jones With More Upside to Come,"Last week, just days after flirting with the 27,000 threshold and setting new record highs, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged on worries over the impact rising long-term interest rates would have on the economy amid the Federal Reserve’s ongoing tightening cycle. This week, after the harrowing selloff, U.S. equities found respite thanks to these Dow Jones stocks.

But investors aren’t quite out of the woods just yet. Adding to the worries has been a persistent bid in crude oil prices and the rollout of third-quarter corporate earnings results.

On the technical basis, the market selloff is looking extended here and stocks are prone to rebounding. These seven titans of the Dow Jones should continue to lead the charge higher:

Chevron (CVX)

Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX ) share are possibility finding support near the lower end of a consolidation range going back to April — setting up a relief rally back up and over its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. Earlier this month, the company was added to Goldman Sachs conviction buy list.

The company will next report results on Nov. 2 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.16 per share on revenues of $47 billion. When the company last reported on July 27, earnings of $1.78 per share missed expectations by 31 cents on a 22.5% rise in revenues.

Boeing (BA)

Boeing (NYSE: BA ) shares are rebounding back above their 50-day moving average on Monday, recovering from a decline of roughly 10% from the high set earlier this month.

The company has been on the front line of trade concerns between the United States and China, which was a topic asked of President Trump in a recent 60 Minutes segment. With sentiment so low, a positive surprise is likely (such as the resumption of high-level talks between Washington and Beijing).

The company will next report results on Oct. 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.51 per share on revenues of $24.1 billion. When the company last reported on July 25, earnings of $3.33 per share beat estimates by eight cents on a 5.2% rise in revenues.

Intel (INTC)

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) shares are testing support near the $44-a-share level and look set for another run at the 200-day moving average, which would be worth a 10% gain from here.

Shares have been on the slide since peaking in early June on worries over end-demand for memory chips, which has resulted in bloated inventories and price pressure.

The company will next report results on Oct. 25 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.15 per share on revenues of $18.1 billion. When the company last reported on July 26, earnings of $1.04 beat estimates by seven cents on a 14.9% rise in revenues.

Verizon (VZ)

As a defensive, non-cyclical telecom stock Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) shares have enjoyed relative price stability over the past week — holding within the confines of a multi-month consolidation range. The stock recently enjoyed a price target upgrade from analysts at UBS, who are now looking for $80 a share.

The company will next report results on Oct. 23 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.19 per share on revenues of $32.5 billion. When the company last reported on July 24, earnings of $1.20 beat estimates by five cents on a 5.4% rise in revenues.

McDonald’s (MCD)

McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD ) shares were caught in the whirlwind of selling last week but remain within the confines of a medium-term uptrend going back to early August. The 50-day moving average is providing support. The stock was upgraded by analysts at Evercore ISI this morning, providing a tailwind to sentiment.

The company will next report results on Oct. 23 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2 per share on revenues of $5.3 billion. When the company last reported on July 26 earnings of $1.99 beat estimates by seven cents on an 11.5% decline in revenues.

Coca-Cola (KO)

Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) shares are rebounding on support from its late August lows, setting up another run at overhead resistance near the $46.50 level. The company was recently on a list of defensive domestic plays highlighted by Deutsche Bank analysts despite broad fundamental pressure on tiger beverages space.

The company will next report results on Oct. 30 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 55 cents per share on revenues of $8.2 billion. When the company last reported on July 25, earnings of 61 cents per share beat estimates by a penny on an 8.3% decline in revenue.

Disney (DIS)

Disney (NYSE: DIS ) shares are among the better performers on the day, rallying 1.2% so far to cross back up and over both the 50-day and 20-day moving averages. The stock remains within the confines of a multi-month trading range going back to July. Watch for another run over double-top resistance near $118 — which would be worth a 4% gain from here.

The company will next report results on Nov. 8 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.35 per share on revenues of $13.8 billion. When the company last reported on Aug. 7, earnings of $1.87 missed estimates by eight cents on a 7% rise in revenues.

"Asian shares climb on strong US corporate earnings, data","U.S. stocks rocketed to their biggest gain in six months Tuesday following strong earnings from major financial and health care companies as well as encouraging reports on the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 547 points.

SINGAPORE (AP) — Asian markets rose on Wednesday as robust U.S. corporate earnings and encouraging data assuaged worries about softening global growth.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 jumped 1.3 percent to 22,842.12. The Kospi in South Korea advanced 1.1 percent to 2,169.20. The Shanghai Composite rose 0.1 percent to 2,548.88. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.2 percent to 5,938.67. Shares rose in Taiwan, Indonesia and Singapore. Markets in Hong Kong were closed for a holiday.

WALL STREET: U.S. stocks bounced back from a series of losses, racking up their biggest gain in six months on Tuesday. The S&P 500 index rallied 2.1 percent, its largest jump since March 26, to 2,809.92. But the index was still 4.1 percent lower than its record high in late September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 2.2 percent to 25,298.42, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.9 percent to 7,645.49. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks climbed 2.8 percent to 1,596.84.

U.S. EARNINGS: Major financial and health care companies reported strong profits for the third quarter on Tuesday, surpassing market expectations. UnitedHealth, the country’s biggest health insurer, exceeded analyst’s projections for the quarter and raised its projections for the year. Its stock climbed 4.7 percent to $272.57. Investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs did well too, sending their shares on a rally. Sentiment was also lifted by encouraging data. The Labor Department said U.S. employers posted the most jobs in two decades and hiring was at a record high. The Federal Reserve reported that output by U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose in September despite Hurricane Florence. But an industrial production report that suggested inflation held steady convinced investors that Fed will not pick up the pace of interest rate hikes, analysts said.

ANALYST’S TAKE: “Asia Pacific markets have kickstarted the day in synchronized gains owing to the relief in the U.S., sustaining the trend in taking after overnight leads,” Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.

UBER IPO: According to a media report, Uber has received proposals from investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs that valued the ride hailing company at as much as $120 billion. The Wall Street Journal said Uber may launch an initial public offering early next year, citing people familiar with the matter. Apart from scandals including workplace harassment, Uber faces intensifying competition and sold its Southeast Asian operations to rival Grab in March.

ENERGY: U.S. benchmark crude added 11 cents to $72.03 a barrel. The contract gained 0.2 percent to close at $71.92 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 8 cents to $81.49 a barrel. It added 0.8 percent to $81.41 per barrel in London.

CURRENCIES: The dollar strengthened to 112.39 yen from 112.28 yen late Tuesday. The euro fell to $1.1563 from $1.1575."

Watch US stocks trade in real time here.

Stocks notched their best day since March on Tuesday as strong earnings reports helped lift spirits on Wall Street, following a sell-off that had shaved thousands of points from the major US indices last week.

The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 2.17%, 0r nearly 550 points, after ending lower four out of the previous five sessions. The Nasdaq composite jumped 2.89%, and the S&P 500 was up 2.15%.

Financial and healthcare companies led the way higher after posting better-than-expected financial reports for the third quarter. Even technology companies, which bore the brunt of the recent rout, were able to gain.

Boosted by investment-banking revenue, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs easily topped analyst forecasts. Johnson & Johnson also beat, helped by a jump in prescription sales. Netflix is expected to report after the bell.

Investors dumped relatively safe US government bonds, with yields on the 10- and two-year notes edging higher.

""With both Treasuries and equities beginning to settle in to their new respective trading ranges, investors have been able to refocus their attention on earnings and other economic indicators,"" said Scott Buchta, the head of fixed-income strategy at Brean Capital.

In a report out Tuesday, the Labor Department said US employers posted the most jobs in nearly two decades in August.

With unemployment at multi-decade lows and signs wage growth could pick up, many are expecting the Federal Reserve meeting minutes out Wednesday to signal another rate hike this December.

The housing market will also be in focus this week, with economists expecting a string of government data to point to a potential slowdown in residential real estate activity across the US. Housing starts and building permits are set to be released on Wednesday and existing home sales on Friday."

Dow ends nearly 550 points higher as upbeat earnings send stocks soaring,"Stocks closed higher Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallying nearly 550 points on upbeat earnings and robust economic data, marking the biggest one-day percentage gain for major indexes since late March.

The tech sector, which had led Monday’s decline, bounced back resoundingly to lead the market higher.

How did the benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average YMZ8, +0.78% jumped 547.87 points, or 2.2%, to 25,798.42, recording its biggest point gain since March. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.82% gained 59.13 points, or 2.2%, to 2,809.92 with tech and health care among the strongest performers in a session where all 11 sectors finished higher. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% climbed 214.75 points, or 2.9%, to 7,645.49. It was the biggest single-day advance for all three indexes since March 26.

What drove the markets?

Stocks are expected to increasingly take their cue from the corporate sector, with third-quarter earnings season under way in earnest this week. A round of upbeat results Tuesday from heavyweights including Goldman Sachs Inc., UnitedHealthGroup and Morgan Stanley helped set the tone.

In recent sessions, investors have been concerned over the pace of rising bond yields, global trade tensions and questions about economic growth, factors that have had an outsize impact on large-capitalization tech-related names with overseas operations.

Meanwhile, the market has also closely watched negotiations between the European Union and Britain as it attempts to exit from the trade bloc with a trade agreement in hand. The potential for a clash between Italy and the European Union over Rome’s budget plans is also in the spotlight. Both matters threaten to disrupt global markets should they sour.

Which data were in focus?

U.S. industrial production rose 0.3% in September, according to the Federal Reserve, beating Wall Street expectations of 0.1%, according to a MarketWatch Survey.

The number of job openings in the U.S. reached another all-time high of 7.1 million in August, according a report released Tuesday morning by the Labor Department. The same report showed that American workers were voluntarily quitting their jobs at a rate of 2.4% in August, matching the July reading, which was the highest since 2001.

The National Association of Home Builders Confidence Index ticked up one point to 68 in October, though it remains down from a cycle high of 74, reached in December 2017.

What were analysts saying?

Tuesday’s gains prove that last week’s declines were “just normal volatility,” rather than evidence of a fundamental shift in investor sentiment, said Jim Smigiel, chief investment officer of absolute return strategies at SEI.

Read: These sudden stock-market plunges really are much more frequent, this chart shows

Nevertheless, Smigiel argued that “the strongest gains in equity markets are behind us,” and that volatility could be a constant companion for investors going forward as “chances of a surprise on the upside are lower than on the downside,” when it comes to the broader U.S. economy.

Tech stocks were helping to lead the way due to “a healthy mix of positive sell-side commentary” and Adobe raising its revenue targets Monday evening, according to Joel Kulina of Wedbush Securities.

Which stocks were in focus?

Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -2.13% rose 3% after the bank reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $6.28, versus analysts expectations of $5.38.

Morgan Stanley GS, -2.13% rallied 5.7% after it posted a 20% increase in profits to $2.15 billion. The retail brokerage’s revenue grew to $4.4 billion for the quarter, 4% higher year-over-year.

Tesla Inc. TSLA, +2.73% shares climbed 6.6% after a federal judge approved the settlement between the electric-car company and its chief executive, Elon Musk, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. NFLX, -0.91% gained 4.7%, helping to push the Dow higher, after the managed health-care company beat analysts earnings and revenue targets, while raising its outlook for full-year 2018 earnings.

Johnson & Johnson NFLX, -0.91% rose 2% after the consumer staples giant beat earnings and revenue estimates.The New-Jersey based firm also raised its earnings outlook for the year.

Adobe NFLX, -0.91% shares soared 9.5%, making the stock one of the S&P 500’s top gainers, following its revenue growth update late Monday.

How did other markets trade?

Asian stocks ended higher, with Japan’s Nikkei NIK, +0.40% outperforming peers, while European indexes gained as Italian stocks surged.

Crude-oil prices US:CLX8 rose moderately, while gold prices GCZ8, -0.16% settled marginally higher and the U.S. dollar index DXY, +0.42% traded flat.
