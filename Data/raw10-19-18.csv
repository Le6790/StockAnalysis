Dow Jones Stock Procter & Gamble Breaks Out,"Procter & Gamble (PG) led the Dow Jones industrial average Friday amid a volatile day in the stock market. The blue chip stock is breaking out above a buy point after a big earnings beat Friday.

X

Consumer-products giant Procter & Gamble makes Tide detergent and Gillette razors among a slew of other products. Early Friday, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal Q1 earnings, sparking a nearly 9% gain.

For the quarter, earnings grew 3% vs. the year ago period, while revenue was flat. Both figures were above consensus estimates. Beauty products fueled the company's growth with a 7% increase. According to JPMorgan, better-than-expected organic sales growth headlined the company's earnings release. List prices more than offset couponing during the quarter. JPMorgan has a neutral rating on the stock.

The IBD Dividend Leader will pay out its upcoming quarterly dividend in the amount of nearly 72 cents per share on Nov. 15 to shareholders of record on Oct. 19. The annualized yield is 3.3%.

P&G Breaks Out, Falls Back

Procter & Gamble stock broke out above a cup with handle's 86.38 buy point early Friday, as the stock gained as much as 8.7% to 87.24. But the stock trimmed gains in midday trade, for a while falling back below the 86.38 level. Volume was well above average, as institutions rushed into the Dow Jones component.

The cup with handle spans back to a high of 93.14 in mid-December, with the stock correcting as much as 25% from its 52-week high.

RS Line Hits Multimonth High

Bullishly the stock's relative strength line is hitting levels not seen since February. While it's not reaching a new 52-week high, it is showing significant strength in a stock market correction. The RS line measures a stock's price performance compared to the general market.

During market correction, investors should be focusing on stocks that have strengthening RS lines. They could be potential market leaders in the event of a new uptrend.

Dow Jones Today: Dow Stocks And Stock Market News

Retailer Ulta Beauty Leads These 4 Top Stocks Holding Up In Weak Market"
"If the Dow dropped 22% like it did in 1987, it would mean a loss of more than 5,700 points today","Friday marked the 31st anniversary of ""Black Monday,"" by far the worst day ever in the U.S. stock market.

On that day — Oct. 19, 1987 — the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 22.6 percent, or 507.99 points at the time. If that kind of plunge were to happen today, the point loss would be far worse.

A 22.6 percent plunge on the 30-stock Dow today would amount to a 5,735.76-point loss. For context, the biggest one-day point loss on the Dow took place on Feb. 5, when it closed down 1,175.21 points. But that was less than 5 percent.

Source: FactSet

Black Monday took place amid a combination of narrow market leadership, a collapse in the U.S. dollar and volatile swings in equities throughout the 1987 summer even as the economy ran hot that year. Other crashes have occurred since then, including the so-called Flash Crash of 2010.

Today, very few market experts expect a crash as the U.S. economy, along with corporate earnings, are growing at a solid pace. Safeguards and regulation have also been implemented to protect against such sharp drops.

But JC Parets, founder of All Star Charts, says a U.S. market crash is quite possible as equities slug through a tough October.

""The ingredients for a market crash are absolutely starting to appear,"" Parets said in a blog post Thursday. There is ""very limited upside to buying stocks, other than for counter-trend trades, but unlimited downside potential.""

""People underestimate the power of a leverage unwind and forced selling,"" he added. ""Now, does it have to be a crash? No. We can trade in a range for a while.""

The S&P 500 and Dow are down 4.2 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively, in October. If the S&P 500 closes lower for the month, it would snap a six-month winning streak. The Dow is on pace to post its first monthly loss in four months.

The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.44% also was trading sharply lower, retreating 1.4% at 2,770. Less than a handful of shares of the S&P 500’s technology sector were trading in the green, with losses led by declines of at least 3% in Adobe Inc. ADBE, -3.31% and Autodesk Inc. ADSK, -3.16% Shares of internet-related company Netflix Inc. NFLX, -4.93% which is in a new S&P 500 sector called communication services, were down sharply.

"Stocks Rebound As Apple, P&G And Disney Lead Dow Higher","Stocks jumped out of the starting gate Friday, as earnings news and analyst actions helped bolster a rebound from Thursday's sharp decline.

X

PayPal (PYPL), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Skechers (SKX) knocked out hefy gains following quarterly reports. Apple (AAPL) (IBD) jumped after Wedbush initiated coverage with an outperform rating and a 310 price target. Dentsply Sirona (XRAY) powered higher on an upgrade from Goldman Sachs. Atlassian (TEAM) and eBay (EBAY) suffered deep early losses.

The Nasdaq Composite swung up 0.6%, with PayPal and Dentsply Sirona leading the Nasdaq 100. China-based names were also prominent, with NetEase (NTES) and Baidu (BIDU) near the top of the Nasdaq 100.

On the Dow, gains from Procter & Gamble easily outflanked DowDupont's (DWDP) early declines to lift the index 0.3% in opening trade.

The S&P 500 also gained 0.3%. PayPal, Procter & Gamble and Dentsply led the index, while eBay fell furthest among S&P 500 stocks, after an analyst downgrade.

Stock Futures: Crafting A Bottom

The back-and-forth week sends the Dow into Friday's session up 0.2% through Thursday, as the market aims to stop its three-week pullback. The Nasdaq was down 0.2% for the week, and the S&P 500 showed a 1.6% advance. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are struggling to hold support at their 200-day moving averages. The Dow has held firmly above that line. The S&P 500 ended Thursday's session precisely at that moving average. Froday's early action hauled the Nasdaq back above the line of support.

All three indexes have remained above their Oct. 11 lows, which means the market remains on the lookout for a potential follow-through session.

Procter & Gamble, PayPal, Skechers Stake Early Leads

On the Dow, Procter & Gamble blasted ahead 6.6% as a 3% gain in fiscal first-quarter earnings and a 0.2% rise in revenue was enough to beat analyst forecasts. Full-year revenue and earnings guidance were to the high side of analyst projections. The gain lifted the stock to less than 1% below a September high, and back above its 10-week moving average.

PayPal spiked 10% as BTIG Research upgraded the stock to a buy and JPMorgan hoisted its price target after a solid third-quarter report late Thursday. BTIG Research also lifted eBay to a buy rating. Following suit, JPMorgan raised its price target on eBay to 103, from 98. The move sent shares back above their 40-week moving average.

Skechers rocketed 19.5% — despite reporting a mixed third-quarter performance. Revenue was weaker than expected, but strong fourth-quarter revenue and earnings guidance cheered investors. The gap up move hoisted shares back above their 10-week moving average, but left them below their 40-week line and still down 28% from an April high.

Analyst Action: Disney, Apple, Dentsply

Walt Disney (DIS) flashed up 1.3% after Barclays raised the stock to overweight, from equal weight, and marked up its price target to 130, from 105. Disney shares are trading just below a 118 buy point, after pulling back from a test of 10-week support. Investors are advised to not purchase stocks — even if they break out past buy points — while the market remains in a correction.

Apple buzzed 1.5% higher after a Wedbush report set a 310 price target and an outperform rating on the stock. The note said Wall Street fears about the stock largely were alleviated by rising average sales prices and rising gross margins heading into the 2019 product cycle. Apple shares have been consolidating since early September, and fighting to retake their 10-week moving average for most of this month.

Dental products supplier Dentsply Sirona nipped ahead 5.5%. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to buy from sell. Shares have been in a 22-month dive, closing on Thursday 50% below their December 2017 high.

Other Earnings: Intuitive, Cleveland Cliffs Reverse

Intuitive Surgical reversed its early gain and dipped 0.4%. The maker of DaVinci robotic surgical tools reported a 2% third-quarter earnings gain and a 14% revenue increase late Thursday. It also reported a 20% jump in procedures using its remote-controlled instruments. Shares are pulled back 10% from an early October high, and looking to retake support at their 10-week moving average.

Iron ore miner Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) opened 2% higher, then turned and dived 6%.Management sweetened a powerful third-quarter performance by announcing an annual dividend of 20 cents. A modest three-week pullback had left Cleveland Cliff shares testing support at their 10-week moving average. Friday's move broke that support in heavy trade.

Interpublic Group (IPG) sailed 6% higher after reporting strong third-quarter results and receiving a price-target hike from Citigroup.

Home Sales, Rig Count Data Due

Two key data points are due out Friday. September existing home sales numbers from the National Association of Realtors are scheduled for release at 10 a.m. ET. Baker Hughes (BHGE) weekly rig count survey lands at 1 p.m. ET.

Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic joins a panel discussion in Macon, Ga. at 12 p.m. ET, and Robert Kaplan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, participates in a Q&A session at New York's Princeton Club at 12:45 p.m. ET.

Oil prices gained, with West Texas Intermediate rising 1.1% to $69.37 per barrel. That was down more than 3% in a second straight weekly decline from an Oct. 3 peak. Gold rose 0.3% to $1,229.88 an ounce. Bonds remained effectively flat, with the 10-year yield steady at 3.18%.

Shanghai Stocks Jump, China GDP Growth Slows

China's markets gained, with the Shanghai Composite recovering from early losses to post a powerful 2.6% rebound, despite slightly weaker-than-expected GDP growth data for the third quarter. Official China GDP numbers reported 6.5% growth for the quarter, below analyst views and the official target of a 6.6% gain. But uncertainty over the official numbers had some analysts calling for much lower readings.

The Shanghai Composite ended the week down 2.1%, digging deeper into bear market territory and marking its lowest weekly close since November 2014. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.4% Friday, taking a 0.9% loss for the week.

The optimism did not ripple through to Japan, where Tokyo's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.6% to end the week down 0.7%. The benchmark ended the week 7.8% below its Oct. 2 high, and riding support above its 200-day moving average.

Trade remained mixed in Europe, where London's FTSE 100 was up 0.4% in afternoon action, while Frankfurt's DAX fell 0.2% and the CAC-40 in Paris dived 0.7%.

"Chinese stocks notch best day since August as officials calm worries about market, economy","China’s main equity benchmarks on Friday produced their best daily gains since early August to end another ugly week on a high note, after Beijing officials offered apparently calming comments about the health of the economy following third-quarter gross domestic product that came in weaker than expected.

The Shanghai SHCOMP, +0.81% gained 2.6% to mark its best one-session rise since Aug. 7, according to FactSet data, while the small-capitalization Shenzhen Composite 399106, +0.93% also jumped 2.6%, representing its best session since Aug.9. Both indexes were down solidly to start Friday’s session.

For the week, however the Shanghai index marked its second straight weekly drop, falling 2.2%, At its current pace, the Shanghai is tracking its worst month, down 9.6%, since January of 2016 when it fell 23%. The Shenzhen, meanwhile, closed the week off 2.5%, logging its third consecutive weekly loss, while the stock gauge also is looking at its steepest weekly fall, off 12.3%, since the first month of 2016.

China’s GDP grew 6.5% from the same quarter a year earlier, down slightly from 6.7% growth in the previous quarter and off analysts' expectations of a 6.6% growth. The pace was China’s worst since the first quarter of 2009. But investors were apparently heartened by statements from Chinese banking regulators to remain calm.

Vice Premier Liu said in an interview with the state-run Xinhua News Agency that Beijing values a healthy stock market, and financial regulators have recently announced new reform measures.

Liu said China attaches importance to the health of its stock market, and said U.S.-China trade clashes were affecting sentiment. “Frankly, the psychological impact is bigger than the actual impact,” he said.

Liu’s comments follow those from People’s Bank of China governor and banking and securities regulators, who all called on investors to maintain their composure. Guo Shuqing, the banking and insurance chief, said recent “abnormal fluctuations” in Chinese stock markets don’t reflect the country’s economic fundamentals and “stable financial system,” the Wall Street Journal reported.

Hong Kong stocks also enjoyed a rebound on the day, with the Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.21% closing 0.4% higher, after falling almost 1% earlier. The index fell 1% for the week, ringing up its fourth straight weekly loss. Tencent shares 0700, +0.00% gained 0.6%, sunny and Sunny Optical 2382, -1.24% finished the session up 0.8%, both stocks reversed earlier sharp declines.

Japan’s Nikkei NIK, +0.40% however, closed down 0.6%, as the machinery sector sank, with manufacturer Komatsu 6301, +0.70% shedding 3.1%. The Nikkei booked a weekly slide of 0.7%, its third straight. Meanwhile, in tech, Sharp Corp.’s stock fell by 3.4% 6753, -4.91% and those for Nintendo 7974, -0.72% fell 4% amid gains in the Japanese yen earlier in Asian hours.

In other benchmarks, South Korea’s Kospi SEU, -0.82% rose 0.4%, Taiwan’s Taiex Y9999, +0.03% slid about 0.4%, Australia’s ASX 200 XJO, -1.58% receded 0.1%, while New Zealand’s benchmark NZ50GR, +0.33% closed 1.2% lower. Benchmark indexes in Singapore STI, +0.26% and Malaysia FBMKLCI, -0.97% both finished modestly lower.

"Dow Gains 65 Points, but It was Still a Miserable Friday","Text size

Nowhere to Go. It is hard to be downbeat on a Friday, but the market sure tried. The Dow, which had been up more than 200 points early in the day, closed up less than a third of that, while the Nasdaq finished in the red. At least PayPal and Procter & Gamble got investors excited with jumping more than 8%. In today’s After the Bell, we…

The stock market was still looking for direction at the close of trading Friday, with the S&P 500 finishing off 0.04% at 2767.78, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.5% at 7449.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 64.89 points, or 0.3%, to 25,444.34.

Market concerns about trade have recently returned after remaining dormant for a while. After imposing 10% tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods in September, President Trump has threatened to increase the rate to 25% on Jan. 1 and possibly add another $257 billion worth of products to the list. That would cover almost all of the Chinese imports to the U.S.

Although it’s reported that President Trump and China’s President Xi are planning to meet for talks at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires next month, it remains unclear how constructive the negotiations can be.

The market has been trying to digest the trade war, but signs are emerging that tariff’s are beginning to have an impact on earnings. And with earnings growth expected to slow in 2019, tariffs could take an even bigger bite out of the market, writes Barclays strategist Maneesh Deshpande in a note on Friday. Assuming a full-blown trade war with 25% tariffs on all U.S.-China trade, the S&P 500 is likely to take a 3% hit in 2019, according to Deshpande.

The trade impact on individual companies can vary significantly across the market, however. For investors looking to trade on the vulnerabilities, Barclays has some recommendations to bet against, or for our readers just to avoid.

Deshpande and his team selected a basket of 30 stocks that are likely to be most impacted by the trade war. The selection is based on import and export data at the industry level, as well as insight from the firm’s equity analysts. Retail stores, for example, were removed as they don’t carry their own brands, but mostly sell products from other manufacturers, who are the real importers. Stocks with an Overweight rating from Barclays analysts were also excluded as they are protected by strong fundamentals and positive catalysts.

Most of the stocks in the basket are concentrated in the consumer discretionary, information technology and industrials sectors, according to the strategist. Ralph Lauren (RL), Arconic (ARNC), and Mattel (MAT), would be among the hardest hit, while Apple (AAPL) also made the basket.

This basket of stocks underperformed the equal-weighted S&P 500 when the trade war first heated up back in February, but then remained rangebound for much of the year. However, these stocks have started to underperform again over the past few days, an indication that investors are now more aggressively pricing in the trade risk, wrote Deshpande.

Ignore it at your own risk.
