October Is a Good Month for the Dow. It’s Even Better During a Midterm Year,"October brings back a lot of bad memories…even when the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 1% to start the month. The 10th month, after all, has seen some of the worst crashes including those in 1929, 1987, and 2008. So it may be surprising to learn that the S&P 500 and the Dow have averaged a higher return in October than in any other month over the past 20 years.

And this October has the potential to be a strong one thanks to the coming midterm election, as midterm years have been historically quite strong for the stock market and the month of October specifically, according to senior market strategist Ryan Detrick for LPL Financial.

The S&P 500 has gained 3.3% on average in October during a midterm year, ranking as the best-performing month even ahead of the usually bullish November and December, Detrick observes in a note today. “Incredibly, since 1982, the scary month of October has seen stocks fall only once during a midterm year,” he explains. “Not to mention it has been the best month overall going clear back to 1950 for all midterm years.”

Who says Halloween has to be scary?"
