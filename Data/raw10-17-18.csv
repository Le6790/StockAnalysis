Dow falls in volatile session after Fed hints at more rate hikes ahead,"More scared asset bubbles will create a recession rather than inflation, says strategist 11:00 AM ET Wed, 17 Oct 2018 | 03:25

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Wednesday in volatile trading after a summary of the Federal Reserve's most-recent meeting showed the central bank was leaning toward more rate hikes moving forward.

The 30-stock index dropped 91.74 points to 25,706.68 as sharp losses in IBM offset strong gains in Goldman Sachs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed just below the flatline at 2,809.21 and 7,642.70, respectively.

The major averages closed well off their session lows, however. The Dow fell as much as 319.26 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both dropped at least 1 percent at their lows of the day.

According to the minutes from the Fed's September meeting, the central bank remains convinced it needs to tighten monetary policy to keep the economy steady.

""The risk of inflation overheating currently is small, but the Fed is communicating that if inflation were to rise aggressively beyond their forecast, then they would hike rates above the neutral rate of 3.00%,"" Jim Caron, managing director at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said in a note.

The 10-year Treasury note yield traded around 3.19 percent after the minutes were released. Goldman Sachs rose 3 percent while Morgan Stanley gained 2.7 percent. Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase both rose more than 1 percent.

The major indexes traded in a wide range before the minutes were released as investors grappled with a flood of corporate earnings and weakness in the housing market.

""We have a market that's gyrating, trying to find a bottom,"" said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. ""This will continue until earnings reaffirm the outlook for next year.""

""Bottoms are a process, not events,"" Essaye added. ""It usually take several days and sometimes several weeks.""

Netflix posted third-quarter earnings that easily beat expectations. The big beat was driven by stronger-than-expected subscriber growth in both the U.S. and overseas. Its stock rose 5.3 percent."
Dow opens more than 100 points lower after sharp Tuesday rebound,"U.S. stocks posted a mostly lower open Wednesday, a day after major indexes saw their biggest one-day rise since late March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.79% was off 126 points, or 0.5%, at 25,672, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.82% shed 0.1% to 2,807.13. The Nasdaq Composite was up slightly, however, rising 0.1% to 7,653. All three indexes rose more than 2% on Tuesday, taking back some of last week's steep losses, as investors appeared to cheer upbeat earnings. The Nasdaq was buoyed by gains for Netflix Inc. NFLX, -0.91% which rose more than 7% after reporting quarterly results late Tuesday.

Wednesday’s action followed a strong day for markets, with the Dow and the S&P both rising 2.2%, and the Nasdaq climbing 2.9%.

What’s drove the market?

The minutes of the Fed’s September meeting, which saw policy makers deliver a widely expected quarter-point increase, showed that a majority of policy makers believe interest rates must continue to rise until policy becomes restrictive.

Minutes aren’t ordinarily a source of volatility, however, the outsize focus on Treasury rates—notably a rise in the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% to a seven-year high last week—ensured they were closely read. Meanwhile, the market continued to closely watch negotiations between the European Union and Britain as it attempts to exit from the trade bloc with a trade agreement in hand. The potential for a clash between Italy and the European Union over Rome’s budget plans also remains in the spotlight.

Traders also took notice of an interview Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross gave to CNBC on Wednesday, in which he said that U.S.-China trade talks are on “hiatus” for now, but not at an impasse.

Which data were in focus?

The number of new homes under construction fell 0.6% to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.201 million in September. The rate was 1% below last year’s levels. The numbers nearly matched the consensus forecast of 1.208 million produced by a MarketWatch survey of economists.

Permits for construction of new homes also fell 5.3% in September from the month before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.241 million. The number represents a 3.7% increase year-over-year, but still was weaker than average analysts expectations polled by FactSet for a pace of 1.28 million new permits.

What were analysts saying?

“The market is interpreting the Fed minutes as slightly hawkish,” said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist with CFRA. For a while the market didn’t believe the Fed was serious about raising rates four times this year and three times in 2019, she said. But that changed after hawkish comments from Fed Chairman Powell earlier this month. “The FOMC minutes are another reminder that the Fed is serious, and isn’t going to let President Trump bully them” into a more dovish stance, said Bell, referring to comments the president made this week criticizing Fed policy, the latest in a string of criticisms.

“We had a big day yesterday, and today’s open shows that volatility is not going away,” said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of asset management firm Cornerstone Wealth Group. With interest rates markedly higher today than even one month ago, investors will remain cautious, and the early morning downturn is evidence of this change in sentiment, he said. “But when you look at the fundamentals of the economy and the market, we expect the market to ultimately move upward.”

Mark Espisito, chief executive of Espisito Securities shared this optimism. “We still see a strong earnings season and a strong stock market for the next year or so,” he said. “Even when there is a pullback like this morning, it’s met with resistance.”

He argued that the reversal of steep early morning losses in the major indexes is proof that there is “consistent buying interest when markets move down,” because investors are still betting on a strong economy and strong earnings to power stocks higher.

Which stocks were in focus?

Shares of Netflix Inc. NFLX, -0.91% rose a day after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results. The stock climbed 5.28%
