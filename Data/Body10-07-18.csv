youve probably heard tilray nasdaq tlry mentioned or read about the stock more times than you can keep track of over the last few weeks the marijuana stocks phenomenal rise fall and rebound have certainly attracted plenty of attention tilrays performance has made auxly cannabis groups nasdaqoth cbwtf yeartodate gain of around 25 seem puny in comparison auxly definitely hasnt gotten even a fraction of the hype that tilray has continue reading below but which is the better marijuana stock now heres a quick look at how tilray and auxly stack up against each other the case for tilray lets put all the buzz about tilrays stock gyrations aside theres more to tilray than just the sizzle thats drawn so much attention lately tilray already has a solid business supplying medical marijuana in canada its potential market will soon dramatically increase canadas recreational marijuana market opens on oct 17 and tilray has lined up supply agreements for the adultuse recreational marijuana market in eight provinces and territories notably including the biggest prize ontario but an even bigger opportunity for tilray lies in international medical cannabis markets the company recently became the first canadian marijuana grower to win approval to supply both cannabis flower and cannabis oils to germany tilray also has completed shipments of medical cannabis to argentina south africa and the united kingdom it even secured a green light from the us drug enforcement administration to export medical cannabis to the us for a clinical study advertisement the company shouldnt have any major problems fulfilling its supply commitments both at home and internationally tilray should have 912000 square feet of growing space by the end of this year including 230000 square feet at its portugal facility theres also a wild card that could boost tilrays fortunes and its stock the company has been viewed as a top prospect for selection as a cannabis partner by a big company outside of the cannabis industry although nothing has materialized on this front yet scoring a big deal with a big partner would be yet another feather in tilrays cap the case for auxly cannabis group compared to tilray auxly cannabis group has flown under the radar however theres a lot to like about the company and its business model auxly used to be known as cannabis wheaton in homage to wheaton precious metals formerly silver wheaton the largest silver streaming company in the world auxlys founders liked the royalty streaming model that has worked well in the precious metals industry and applied it to the cannabis industry this streaming model involves providing funds to other companies in exchange for a share of future products future revenue andor equity interest today auxly claims five wholly owned subsidiaries and 13 streaming partners these businesses operate across the supply chain of the cannabis industry giving auxly strong vertical integration most of auxlys focus so far has been in canada the company has made multiple acquisitions and streaming deals with marijuana producers to the extent that it expects to have an annual production capacity of 160000 kilograms by 2021 making it one of at least seven canadian marijuana growers on track to top the 100000kilogram mark auxly believes that its funded capacity ranks it fourth among canadian marijuana growers however auxly also has ventured outside of its home country the company recently announced it was buying an 80 stake in inverell a licensed cannabis operator in uruguay this deal is pending approval by uruguayan regulators if it goes through auxly will have a great source for lowcost production of cannabidiol cbd to export to other countries better marijuana stock ive intentionally avoided talking about valuation so far but to determine which of these two marijuana stocks is the better pick for investors we have to address the elephant in the room tilrays market cap stands north of 14 billion auxly cannabis groups market cap is less than 500 million while auxly stock isnt cheap i think its a much better bargain than tilray if you could only choose one of these two marijuana stocks my view is that auxly is the handsdown winner of course investors have plenty of other options while i like auxly over tilray i wouldnt go out on a limb by recommending the stock as a buy marijuana stocks in general are probably too risky for many investors and for aggressive investors my view is that there are even better ways to profit from growth in the global cannabis industry 10 stocks we like better than auxly cannabis
