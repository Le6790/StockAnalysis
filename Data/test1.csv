3 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy Today,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is entering the new week with what is undoubtedly the cleanest bull retracement pattern of the year. Hungry dip buyers were salivating all weekend long in anticipation of a potentially profitable meal. And if you‚Äôve seen what Dow Jones stocks are doing this morning, then you know these hopes were not in vain.

Large-cap stocks are leading the charge delivering a quick 1% gain to the Dow right out of the gate. What‚Äôs perhaps most impressive is the rally comes while the Russell 2000 is falling 0.30% marking some severe divergence between large and small caps. The beauty of last week‚Äôs mild retracement and today‚Äôs pole vault is that many Dow Jones stocks are flashing attractive entry points.

I‚Äôve scoured the entire Index and here are three of the best Dow Jones stocks to buy.

American Express (AXP)

American Express (NYSE: AXP ) enters the new week having fallen five of the past six trading sessions. The retreat came after AXP stock notched a new record high at $111.77. Shorting a stock after a multi-day retracement from all-time highs has got to be one of the dumbest ideas I can think of. It‚Äôs the ultimate low probability play.

And that means doing the opposite is smart. Buying dips in an uptrend, particularly one that just surged in momentum like AXP, means you have the wind at your back. And with the stock already down a few percent from the highs, you‚Äôre getting a nice discount. Furthermore, we‚Äôre now much closer to support levels suggesting the risk is minimal if the setup doesn‚Äôt work.

Sell the Nov $105/$100 put spread for 97 cents.

Exxon Mobil (XOM)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

Oil prices are making a comeback, and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) shares are loving it. After carving out a low near $76 in mid-August, XOM stock rallied uninterrupted to $87. The ascent saw a groundswell in accumulation days signaling institutions were entering the fray.

Last week‚Äôs four-day pullback marks the first quality buying opportunity arising in the oil giant in two months. And I think it‚Äôs an opportunity worth pouncing on. If the slide persists many support levels loom close including old resistance near $84.50 and the rising 20-day moving average.

To build out a high probability of profit, consider selling the Nov $82.50/$77.50 put spread for 70 cents. If XOM stock sits above $82.50 at expiration, you‚Äôll capture the max reward of 70 cents. The initial cost is $4.30.

Boeing (BA)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

Boeing (NYSE: BA ) rounds out today‚Äôs trio with a picture perfect breakout play. This morning‚Äôs 2.5% takeoff is officially carrying BA stock above major long-term resistance, completing an eight-month base. The expression, ‚Äúthe longer the base, the higher in space‚Äù comes to mind here. Given the dominance and duration of Boeing‚Äôs trading range this year, the importance of today‚Äôs breakout can‚Äôt be overstated.

It marks the beginning of the stock‚Äôs next leg higher and an easy entry point for spectators looking for an excuse to climb aboard finally.

Buy the Nov $380/$400 bull call spread for $8.

Dow's nearly 280-point surge puts it on track for best day in more than 6 weeks,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday jumped more than 270 points, putting the blue-chip gauge on track for its best day in six weeks, as Wall Street rallied as the U.S. and Canada forged an 11th hour deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Dow DJIA, -0.11% was up 277 points, or 1%, at 26,733, not far from a new peak for the gauge. An advance of this magnitude, if it holds, would represent the best daily rally for the Dow since Aug. 16 when the index surged 396 points or 1.6%. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% also were driven solidly higher, with the S&P 500 also trading near records. President Donald Trump was set to hold a news conference in the Rose Garden to discuss the updated Nafta accord at 11 a.m. Eastern Time, coming just days after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Congress that the two countries were unlikely to meet that deadline for a pact. The Nafta pact must still be approved by Congress.

"Dow ends about 190 points higher, S&P 500 closes near record as Nafta deal sparks rally","The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday finished the session with a triple-digit advance and the S&P 500 flirted with a fresh all-time high to start the first day of October and the fourth quarter after the U.S. and Canada reached an 11th-hour deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index sat out the day's rally, ending lower on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% rose 193 points, or 0.7%, to reach 26,651, powered by shares of Boeing Co., which delivered a nearly 70-point jolt to the price-weighted blue-chip index. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% closed up 0.4% at 2,924, less than a half-percent short of its Sept. 20 closing high at 2,930.75, while the Nasdaq COMP, -0.25% finished down 0.1% at 8,037. All three benchmarks finished off their best levels of the day. The North American Trade Agreement forged with Canada, brings the U.S.'s northern neighbor into a new trilateral agreement that Mexico had agreed to weeks ago. The deal, known now as the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA, must still be approved by Congress but was heralded by President Donald Trump as a ""historic news."" Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 index RUT, -0.33% of small-capitalization companies, fell 1.5% to end at 1,673, marking its worst day since July 27th, according to FactSet data. The index has been a respite for investors hoping to lessen the impact of trade on their holdings because the revenue of its constituents aren't directly hurt by trade because they tend to be domestically driven. In corporate news, shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.93% jumped after Chairman and Chief Executive Elon Musk settled a Securities and Exchange fraud probe over the weekend and said the company was nearing profitability, while shares of General Electric GE, +2.58% jumped after after the troubled industrial conglomerate said its chief executive officer, John Flannery, was being replaced after a little over a year in the role.

Stocks close mostly higher on new U.S.-Canada Nafta deal,"U.S. stocks closed mostly higher, but off the best levels Monday, after the U.S. and Canada reached a deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. The news helped to alleviate some of the concerns surrounding trade that have periodically weighed on the market over the past several months.

How did major benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% gained 192.90 points, or 0.7%, to 26,651.21 and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.22% advanced 10.61 points, or 0.4%, to 2,924.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% meanwhile, reversed direction to fall 9.05 points, or 0.1%, to 8,037.30.

Monday marked the first day of October, as well as the start of the fourth quarter. The S&P is coming off its best such three-month stretch since 2013, climbing more than 7%, while the Dow advanced 9%. The Nasdaq gained more than 7% during the period, its ninth straight quarterly gain.

What drove trading?

The fourth quarter‚Äôs opening session kicked off with an unexpected breakthrough in U.S.- Canada trade negotiations. In a news conference, President Donald Trump called the deal ‚Äútruly historic.‚Äù Among other changes, the deal for the first time sets rules for categories of financial-services and digital businesses that have emerged since the bloc was created.

The development came just four days after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had told Congress that chances were slim that a Canada deal would be reached in time to meet a U.S.-imposed deadline.

In the latest economic data, a reading on U.S. manufacturing from Markit came in at 55.6, compared with a previous reading of 54.7, while a reading on manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management came in at 59.8, slightly below expectations.

Investors also kept an eye on Europe after Italy‚Äôs antiestablishment government significantly widened its budget-deficit target for next year, potentially setting the country on a collision course with the European Union.

In the U.K., the Conservatives‚Äô annual party conference was getting under way with Prime Minister Theresa May facing pressure over her proposal for future U.K.-EU relations, known as the Chequers plan, which has already been rejected by EU leaders.

What were analysts saying?

‚ÄúAlthough the trade outlook with China remains uncertain, overall trade uncertainty has been receding for months, helping propel stocks to record highs,‚Äù said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. ‚ÄúAnd even when it comes to China many investors are betting there‚Äôs room for a market friendly compromise.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúInternational stocks have even more to gain from trade breakthroughs than their U.S. counterparts because they have been held back too far by trade worries due to their economies‚Äô increased sensitivity to trade.‚Äù

What stocks were in focus?

Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.93% jumped 17% after Chairman and Chief Executive Elon Musk settled a Securities and Exchange fraud probe. The settlement will force him to step down as chairman and cost him and the company a combined $40 million in fines. He also reportedly told employees in a weekend email that the electric-car maker is on the verge of making a profit.

Shares of General Electric Co. GE, +2.58% surged 7.1% after the troubled industrial conglomerate said its chief executive officer, John Flannery, was being replaced after a little over a year in the role. GE named a new CEO, announced a noncash goodwill impairment charge of about $23 billion, and said it would fall short of its 2018 profit outlook. The stock had dropped more than 25% thus far this year.

Pfizer Inc. PFE, +1.36% said that Chief Executive Officer Ian Read plans to step aside at the end of the year, and will hand the reins to deputy Albert Bourla. Shares of the Dow component were up 0.5%.

Cal-Maine Foods Inc. CALM, -1.55% tumbled 6.8% after the company reported first-quarter earnings and sales that missed expectations. It also cut its quarterly dividend.

Viking Therapeutics Inc. shares VKTX, -3.60% slid 7%. The company reported positive results in a midstage trial of a treatment for broken hips.

Shares of Facebook Inc. FB, +1.40% fell 1.2%. The social-media giant had seen its shares slump on Friday, too, after an announcement that hackers had compromised the accounts of more than 50 million users. A European Union privacy watchdog could fine the company as much as $1.63 billion for the data breach.

Shares of Akorn Inc. AKRX, -1.00% plummeted 59% after a Delaware court ruled in favor of Fresenius SE & Co. FRE, +0.19% which has sought to end a $4.3 billion merger with Akorn.

How did other markets trading?

Chinese and Hong Kong markets were closed for holidays, while the Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.40% rose 0.5%. European stocks SXXP, +0.20% were higher after a sluggish start.

Stock Gains Fade As Dow Jones Average Leads Mixed SessionStock Gains Fade As Dow Jones Average Leads Mixed Session,"The major stock indexes closed higher Monday but reversed in the afternoon to wipe out much of the morning gains. The Dow Jones average held most of its gain, ending the first trading session of the new quarter up 0.7%.

X

The fade was most noticeable on the Nasdaq, which was up as much as 0.8% but closed with a loss of 0.1%. The S&P 500 also pared gains and ended 0.4% higher.

Among stocks in the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, Boeing (BA) climbed past the 374.58 entry of a flat base in active trading. Boeing, another trade-sensitive stock, had already cleared the 364.64 correct buy point of a base within the larger pattern.

Dow Jones Leader

Boeing, now up 29.6% since Jan. 1, is a member of IBD Leaderboard.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see the jet maker's earnings rising 30% to $3.54 a share. Boeing has posted strong earnings increases for three straight quarters. Full-year profit is seen up 20% to $14.64 a share.

Small caps struggled, with the Russell 2000 off 1.5% at the closing bell. Volumes rose from Friday's levels, according to early data.

Stocks opened higher after Canadian negotiators late Sunday agreed to join a trade accord with the U.S. and Mexico.

Canadian National Railway (CNI) broke out of a base-on-base pattern. It topped the 90.67 buy point in heavy trading. Shares gapped up, a bullish sign, although the relative strength line has not made a new high. Ideally the RS line would make a new high to solidify the breakout.

Canadian oil company Encana (ECA) rose past the 13.59 proper buy point of a double-bottom base but closed slightly below that. Encana announced today that a subsidiary is selling assets in New Mexico for $480 million to Denver-based DJR Energy.

Besides Dow Jones Names, Energy Stocks Also Lead Upside

A few other energy stocks broke out as well. Continental Resources (CLR) rose above the 70.01 buy point of an undefined base. Shares closed 3% higher and volume was merely average. The RS line has not made a new high.

Auto manufacturers were Monday's best-performing industry group after Tesla (TSLA) shares surged 17% Monday.

Over the weekend, the automaker and CEO Elon Musk reached a settlement with the Securities & Exchange Commission in which Musk will step down as chairman but will keep his CEO title. Musk and Tesla also must each pay $20 million fines and must add two new members to the board. The pact settles a lawsuit that the SEC filed against the company and its CEO over Musk's tweets announcing plans to take the company private.

The stock is attempting to climb back above the 50-day moving average, not that a move above the line would matter much. The stock has been volatile and not behaving well enough to identify a proper follow-on entry.

Meanwhile, President Trump hailed the North American trade deal as a boon to the U.S. auto industry.

Former Dow component General Electric (GE) jumped 7% after paring gains. GE dismissed its top executive, John Flannery, on Monday after little more than a year on the job. Director Lawrence Culp was named chairman and chief executive. GE also announced a big charge for a troubled business and issued a profit warning.

"Apple Raises Dow Jones, Tilray Up; 5 Top Growth Stocks Hit This Sell Signal","The Dow Jones industrial average led a large-cap advance in stocks today, rising nearly 1% and nearly wiping out last week's 1.1% drop. The Dow's strong start in October follows news late Sunday that the U.S. and Canadian trade negotiators ended weeks of wrangling on import tariffs and barriers regarding dairy products and cars.

X

But both sides reportedly have not lifted any tariffs on steel and other products. Small cap stocks, meanwhile, weakened.

At noon time in New York, as many as 13 components with the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1 point or more, including leading stock Boeing (BA). The aerospace giant, a new member of IBD Leaderboard, rose more than 8 points, or 2.3%, to move further past a 364.64 early buy point in a flat base.

That base is lodged inside a longer base. Boeing is also rising past a 374.58 conventional buy point in a three-month flat base.

The Nasdaq composite lagged, up less than 0.5%. Yet the tech-rich index still leads in year-to-date performance, up 17.1%. The Dow, at 26,699, holds an 8% year-to-date gain.

The S&P 500 rallied around 0.6%. Automaker, dairy, movie, rail transport and oil shares paced the upside.

The Dow Jones transportation average gained more than 0.7%. Small caps lost some luster. The Russell 2000 sank 0.4%. Volume is running higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Friday.

The S&P MidCap 400 reversed from an early-morning lift of 0.5% to fall 0.3%. The index is fighting to hold above the 50-day moving average for the past four trading sessions. At 2013, the 400 remains a lagging index, up 5.9% since Jan. 1.

Active Trading Still Outperforms Passive Indexes

The IBD Mutual Fund Index, updated each day in the General Market Indicators chart PDF at the bottom of the daily Big Picture column, shows a 14.7% advance since Jan. 1. The index is composed of 20 top-performing actively managed mutual funds.

Pot stock Tilray (TLRY) gapped up more than 18% to 170.41, notching its highest level since its hairpin dive on Sept. 20. The company's High Park Farms subsidiary received a sales license from Canada's public health agency.

Tilray is just beginning to form a 50-day moving average, which is currently near 67. Watch for a new base to potentially form.

Tesla (TSLA) also regained some mojo with a 16% jump to 307.28 on news that CEO Elon Musk and the Securities & Exchange Commission have settled securities fraud charges.

Both Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million fines each, and the highly regarded entrepreneur will vacate the chairman post.

Tesla shares are still rangebound. The stock still faces a test of upside resistance near the 50-day moving average and are 20% below a 52-week peak. Wall Street expects the EV pioneer to post a profit of $2.83 a share in 2019.

Apple Helps Dow Jones Firm Up

Apple (AAPL) is also leading the Dow Jones industrials, making a fifth advance in the past six sessions. Shares of the iPhone, wearables, MacBook and digital services giant rallied more than 1.3% to 228.68. The stock is close to breaching its all-time high of 229.67.

Shares have issued an offense-type sell signal ‚Äî that is, for those who bought at the 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom on May 4 or soon after, Apple has now achieved a 25% profit.

Analysts expect fiscal Q4 profit to climb 34% to $2.77 a share.

Apple has grown earnings 2%, 11%, 18%, 24%, 16%, 30% and 40% vs. year-ago levels in the past seven quarters.

Higher-priced growth stocks generally backtracked, but few were issuing defensive sell signals.

4 More Stocks Hit An Offense-Type Profit-Taking Level

Match Group (MTCH), Veeva Systems (VEEV), Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) and Roku (ROKU) have also gained more than 20% to 25% past their respective breakout points, justifying at least partial profit taking.

Match Group, which owns the Tinder dating app, is making big strides in the university and Japan markets. The stock cleared a 48.75 entry in a unusual-looking cup base on Aug. 9 following blistering Q2 results (earnings up 156% to 41 cents a share, revenue up 36% to $421.2 million). Shares have since risen 25% before pulling back a tad.

Those with either strong conviction or a huge profit cushion could decide to either hold a full position and wait for a potential base to form. Or they could sell some shares and sit on the rest of the position until a key defense-type sell signal triggers, or more than one sell signal hits the stock chart simultaneously.

The Street sees Match Group's profit rising 117% this year to $1.41 a share, then lifting another 22% to $1.72 in 2019.

CarGurus Stock Reverses

Midcap growth stock leader CarGurus (CARG), is not issuing any IBD defense-type sell signal for now, even though shares fell as much as 5% and dived beneath a 53.41 buy point in a narrow cup with handle. CarGurus is also a new stock on IBD Leaderboard.

One key sell rule: Lock in gains when a stock pierces through the 50-day or 10-week moving average and fails to rebound quickly.

A second rule: Keep all losses small.

The online marketplace for cars has grown earnings per share by 25%, 50% and 50% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters. The Street sees Q3 profit up 150% to 5 cents a share and full-year earnings up 53% to 23 cents.

CarGurus has 109 million shares outstanding and a market value of almost $6 billion.

Oil Prices Keep Rising

WTI near-term crude oil futures are also having a brilliant start to the new month, rising 2% to $74.72 a barrel. That's the highest level since November 2014.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 2 basis points to 3.07%. The yield got closer to a May 17 peak of 3.11%.

The ISM manufacturing survey, announced Monday morning, reaffirmed busy activity among U.S. factories. The September reading was solid at 59.8. That slightly missed the 59.9 consensus forecast from Econoday.

Dow Jones Futures Up On U.S.-Canada Trade Deal; Tesla Stock Jumps On SEC Settlement,"Dow Jones futures rose strongly Monday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, on a tentative U.S.-Canada trade deal. That should be good news for General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F). Tesla stock is skyrocketing after the SEC settled with Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk. Musk will step down as chairman for at least three years but he can stay on the board and remain CEO. Elon Musk and Tesla will each pay a $20 million penalty. Meanwhile, hot recent IPO Stitch Fix (SFIX) reports earnings Monday.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Signaling strong gains to start the fourth quarter, Dow Jones futures climbed 0.8% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.75% above fair value. Remember that Dow futures and other overnight action don't necessarily translate in actual trading in the next regular session.

U.S.-Canada Trade Deal

Dow futures expanded gains on word that a U.S.-Canada trade talks finally finished with a revised Nafta deal. The U.S. and Canada confirmed the agreement shortly before America's midnight ET deadline. The U.S., Canada and Mexico will revise Nafta, which will be renamed the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement (USMCA).

Canada gave concessions on its dairy market, a sore spot for President Donald Trump. The countries did keep a key dispute mechanism, a win for Canada.

A U.S.-Canada trade accord should ease investor fears. President Trump had threatened to send a bilateral U.S.-Mexico trade deal to Congress with Canada excluded. A continued North America trade deal, even if many experts say the revisions are a net negative, should be good news for automakers, notably GM and Ford. GM stock hit a 16-month last week amid Trump trade war fears and signs of weakening industry sales. Ford stock sank to a 6-year low. Both GM and Ford rose more than 1% before the open on the stock market today.

However, a revised North American trade deal could make it less likely to reach a China trade war peace deal. With North America supply chains still together, the U.S. is at less risk from escalating the China trade war.

SEC Tesla Settlement Boosts Tesla Stock

Tesla stock roared 16% higher to 306.95 early Monday. On Friday, Tesla stock crashed 14% after the SEC sued Elon Musk, accusing him of fraud over his go-private, ""funding secured"" claims back in August. The SEC lawsuit had sought to bar Elon Musk from serving as an officer or director of any company. Wall Street saw Elon Musk's ouster as devastating for Tesla's stock.

That lawsuit and the Tesla stock plunge, apparently spurred Elon Musk to settle, after reportedly rejecting another SEC deal earlier in the week.

This could be a best-possible scenario for Tesla investors. Tesla gets a modest fine. Musk is still CEO, but he'll lose a little control. Someone else will be chairman and the board must add two more independent directors. Plus, Musk must hire an ""experienced securities lawyer"" to vet future tweets.

Still, the SEC-Tesla settlement, and information that the SEC disclosed, will help an ongoing Justice Department probe and shareholder lawsuits. Anyone who was shorting Tesla stock and covered after Elon Musk's infamous go-private ""funding secured"" tweet on Aug. 7 has a strong case. So do investors who bought Tesla stock as result of the go-private effort.

Tesla Model 3 Output Figures

Meanwhile, early this week Tesla should report third-quarter production and delivery figures. Tesla Model 3 output should be 50,000-55,000 in Q3, the company says, with Model 3 deliveries of 55,000 or more. Electrek reported on Friday that Tesla Model 3 output had topped 51,000.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk has admitted trouble getting Model 3 sedans to customers, citing ""delivery logistics hell.""

In a leaked email to Tesla staff, Elon Musk said the company is ""very close"" to profitability. Musk had said he expected profitability in the third quarter. Sustained profitability and positive cash flow is key, because Tesla's cash levels have been dwindling.

Tesla Stock Chart

Perhaps this is the moment that everything starts turning around for Tesla and the stock. But investors are more likely to be successful looking for solidly profitable companies whose stocks are setting up in bullish bases.

For all the talk of Tesla's big run since its IPO, most of those gains came from an April 2013 breakout to early 2014. Actually, Tesla stock closed Friday at 264.22, below its February 2014 peak of 265.

Tesla's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a 21-month low. The RS line should rise some with Tesla shares Monday. But the stock chart is not pretty.

Stitch Fix Earnings

Stitch Fix earnings are due after Monday's market close. Analysts expect fiscal Q4 earnings per share of 4 cents on revenue of $319 million. The online retailer's subscription business selects and delivers apparel to customers. A November 2017 IPO at 15 a share, Stitch Fix stock has soared this year, closing Friday at 43.82.

"Dow Stocks: Apple Stock, Microsoft Stock Walgreens Stock Top Dow Performers In Q3","The Dow Jones industrial average led the way in the third quarter. The blue-chip index in July pivoted from the choppy action of the first half of the year and into a clear uptrend. The top five Dow stocks of the quarter were: Apple (AAPL), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Microsoft (MSFT). Apple stock and Microsoft stock are two of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization.

X

Apple Stock

Apple stock likely has the most compelling chart action of the top Dow stocks. The tech giant is presenting a buying opportunity as it rebounds off the 10-week line for the first time since its August breakout. The first two pullbacks to the 10-week line after a breakout are considered chances to add shares to a position.

Apple stock popped 22% in Q3, more than any other Dow stock. The bulk of that came in August, when shares ran up nearly 20% following strong Apple earnings on July 31.

After another week of trading action, we could see a new chart pattern with a 229.77 buy point. But Apple stock has not yet met the minimum-length requirement for the formation of a proper base.

Apple stock rose 0.9% before the open in Monday's stock market trading.

Walgreens Stock

It might come as a surprise that Walgreens Boots Alliance was one of the top Dow Jones industrial average stocks of Q3, given that it's essentially flat for the year. But in the third quarter the drugstore chain surged 21.5%. Even with the strong gains, Walgreens stock has not yet presented a buying opportunity this year.

The SEC on Friday fined Walgreens Boots Alliance $34.5 million, saying its former CEO and CFO ""misled investors about the company's public financial goal"" over multiple reporting periods prior to the close of its 2014 merger with Alliance Boots. Walgreens in its settlement with the SEC says it ""neither admits nor denies"" the allegations.

When Walgreens issues its quarterly report on Oct. 11, analysts expect earnings growth of 11% on 12% sales growth. That would mark deceleration from the prior quarter.

Walgreens stock was little changed early Monday.

Pfizer Stock

After reporting accelerating quarterly earnings and sales growth in late July, drugmaker Pfizer broke out of a six-month-long consolidation in heavy volume. Pfizer stock is now extended 12% from the 39.53 entry, rising 21.5% for the quarter. The Dow stock is now nearing its all-time high from 1999 after trading essentially sideways for several years.

Pfizer said early Monday that CEO Ian Read will step down by year-end. Albert Bourla will replace him. Pfizer stock edged higher before the open.

Merck Stock

Dow Jones industrial average member Merck stock has similar chart action to its drugmaker peer Pfizer. Shares in recent months broke above yearslong sideways action and are headed toward old highs. But unlike Pfizer stock, Merck stock has not presented a buying opportunity this year.

And, while Pfizer's relative strength line is at a near-term high, Merck's RS line is lagging its Aug. 20 peak despite trading at a higher share price. Still, Merck stock gained 16.9% in Q3.

Merck rose a fraction early Monday.

Microsoft Stock

Lastly, Microsoft stock climbed 16% in the third quarter, and is extended 18% from a flat base that it shaped in Q2. The Dow stock has found support at its 50-day line multiple times along its run. Microsoft is now the third largest company by market cap, behind Apple and Amazon (AMZN), passing Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) several months ago to earn that designation.

Microsoft rose slightly before the open.

Dow Jones Industrial Average: Top Dow Stocks

As of Friday's close, the Dow Jones industrial average in Q3 gained 9%, outpacing gains of about 7% for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Dow stocks Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Visa (V) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also turned in notable performances over the past three months.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks"
3 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy Today,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is entering the new week with what is undoubtedly the cleanest bull retracement pattern of the year. Hungry dip buyers were salivating all weekend long in anticipation of a potentially profitable meal. And if youíve seen what Dow Jones stocks are doing this morning, then you know these hopes were not in vain.

Large-cap stocks are leading the charge delivering a quick 1% gain to the Dow right out of the gate. Whatís perhaps most impressive is the rally comes while the Russell 2000 is falling 0.30% marking some severe divergence between large and small caps. The beauty of last weekís mild retracement and todayís pole vault is that many Dow Jones stocks are flashing attractive entry points.

Iíve scoured the entire Index and here are three of the best Dow Jones stocks to buy.

American Express (AXP)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

American Express (NYSE: AXP ) enters the new week having fallen five of the past six trading sessions. The retreat came after AXP stock notched a new record high at $111.77. Shorting a stock after a multi-day retracement from all-time highs has got to be one of the dumbest ideas I can think of. Itís the ultimate low probability play.

And that means doing the opposite is smart. Buying dips in an uptrend, particularly one that just surged in momentum like AXP, means you have the wind at your back. And with the stock already down a few percent from the highs, youíre getting a nice discount. Furthermore, weíre now much closer to support levels suggesting the risk is minimal if the setup doesnít work.

Sell the Nov $105/$100 put spread for 97 cents.

Exxon Mobil (XOM)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

Oil prices are making a comeback, and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) shares are loving it. After carving out a low near $76 in mid-August, XOM stock rallied uninterrupted to $87. The ascent saw a groundswell in accumulation days signaling institutions were entering the fray.

Last weekís four-day pullback marks the first quality buying opportunity arising in the oil giant in two months. And I think itís an opportunity worth pouncing on. If the slide persists many support levels loom close including old resistance near $84.50 and the rising 20-day moving average.

To build out a high probability of profit, consider selling the Nov $82.50/$77.50 put spread for 70 cents. If XOM stock sits above $82.50 at expiration, youíll capture the max reward of 70 cents. The initial cost is $4.30.

Boeing (BA)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

Boeing (NYSE: BA ) rounds out todayís trio with a picture perfect breakout play. This morningís 2.5% takeoff is officially carrying BA stock above major long-term resistance, completing an eight-month base. The expression, ìthe longer the base, the higher in spaceî comes to mind here. Given the dominance and duration of Boeingís trading range this year, the importance of todayís breakout canít be overstated.

It marks the beginning of the stockís next leg higher and an easy entry point for spectators looking for an excuse to climb aboard finally.

Buy the Nov $380/$400 bull call spread for $8.

Dow's nearly 280-point surge puts it on track for best day in more than 6 weeks,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday jumped more than 270 points, putting the blue-chip gauge on track for its best day in six weeks, as Wall Street rallied as the U.S. and Canada forged an 11th hour deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Dow DJIA, -0.11% was up 277 points, or 1%, at 26,733, not far from a new peak for the gauge. An advance of this magnitude, if it holds, would represent the best daily rally for the Dow since Aug. 16 when the index surged 396 points or 1.6%. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% also were driven solidly higher, with the S&P 500 also trading near records. President Donald Trump was set to hold a news conference in the Rose Garden to discuss the updated Nafta accord at 11 a.m. Eastern Time, coming just days after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Congress that the two countries were unlikely to meet that deadline for a pact. The Nafta pact must still be approved by Congress.

"Dow ends about 190 points higher, S&P 500 closes near record as Nafta deal sparks rally","The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday finished the session with a triple-digit advance and the S&P 500 flirted with a fresh all-time high to start the first day of October and the fourth quarter after the U.S. and Canada reached an 11th-hour deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index sat out the day's rally, ending lower on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% rose 193 points, or 0.7%, to reach 26,651, powered by shares of Boeing Co., which delivered a nearly 70-point jolt to the price-weighted blue-chip index. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% closed up 0.4% at 2,924, less than a half-percent short of its Sept. 20 closing high at 2,930.75, while the Nasdaq COMP, -0.25% finished down 0.1% at 8,037. All three benchmarks finished off their best levels of the day. The North American Trade Agreement forged with Canada, brings the U.S.'s northern neighbor into a new trilateral agreement that Mexico had agreed to weeks ago. The deal, known now as the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA, must still be approved by Congress but was heralded by President Donald Trump as a ""historic news."" Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 index RUT, -0.33% of small-capitalization companies, fell 1.5% to end at 1,673, marking its worst day since July 27th, according to FactSet data. The index has been a respite for investors hoping to lessen the impact of trade on their holdings because the revenue of its constituents aren't directly hurt by trade because they tend to be domestically driven. In corporate news, shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.93% jumped after Chairman and Chief Executive Elon Musk settled a Securities and Exchange fraud probe over the weekend and said the company was nearing profitability, while shares of General Electric GE, +2.58% jumped after after the troubled industrial conglomerate said its chief executive officer, John Flannery, was being replaced after a little over a year in the role.

Stocks close mostly higher on new U.S.-Canada Nafta deal,"U.S. stocks closed mostly higher, but off the best levels Monday, after the U.S. and Canada reached a deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. The news helped to alleviate some of the concerns surrounding trade that have periodically weighed on the market over the past several months.

How did major benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% gained 192.90 points, or 0.7%, to 26,651.21 and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.22% advanced 10.61 points, or 0.4%, to 2,924.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% meanwhile, reversed direction to fall 9.05 points, or 0.1%, to 8,037.30.

Monday marked the first day of October, as well as the start of the fourth quarter. The S&P is coming off its best such three-month stretch since 2013, climbing more than 7%, while the Dow advanced 9%. The Nasdaq gained more than 7% during the period, its ninth straight quarterly gain.

What drove trading?

The fourth quarterís opening session kicked off with an unexpected breakthrough in U.S.- Canada trade negotiations. In a news conference, President Donald Trump called the deal ìtruly historic.î Among other changes, the deal for the first time sets rules for categories of financial-services and digital businesses that have emerged since the bloc was created.

The development came just four days after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had told Congress that chances were slim that a Canada deal would be reached in time to meet a U.S.-imposed deadline.

In the latest economic data, a reading on U.S. manufacturing from Markit came in at 55.6, compared with a previous reading of 54.7, while a reading on manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management came in at 59.8, slightly below expectations.

Investors also kept an eye on Europe after Italyís antiestablishment government significantly widened its budget-deficit target for next year, potentially setting the country on a collision course with the European Union.

In the U.K., the Conservativesí annual party conference was getting under way with Prime Minister Theresa May facing pressure over her proposal for future U.K.-EU relations, known as the Chequers plan, which has already been rejected by EU leaders.

What were analysts saying?

ìAlthough the trade outlook with China remains uncertain, overall trade uncertainty has been receding for months, helping propel stocks to record highs,î said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. ìAnd even when it comes to China many investors are betting thereís room for a market friendly compromise.î

He added: ìInternational stocks have even more to gain from trade breakthroughs than their U.S. counterparts because they have been held back too far by trade worries due to their economiesí increased sensitivity to trade.î

What stocks were in focus?

Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.93% jumped 17% after Chairman and Chief Executive Elon Musk settled a Securities and Exchange fraud probe. The settlement will force him to step down as chairman and cost him and the company a combined $40 million in fines. He also reportedly told employees in a weekend email that the electric-car maker is on the verge of making a profit.

Shares of General Electric Co. GE, +2.58% surged 7.1% after the troubled industrial conglomerate said its chief executive officer, John Flannery, was being replaced after a little over a year in the role. GE named a new CEO, announced a noncash goodwill impairment charge of about $23 billion, and said it would fall short of its 2018 profit outlook. The stock had dropped more than 25% thus far this year.

Pfizer Inc. PFE, +1.36% said that Chief Executive Officer Ian Read plans to step aside at the end of the year, and will hand the reins to deputy Albert Bourla. Shares of the Dow component were up 0.5%.

Cal-Maine Foods Inc. CALM, -1.55% tumbled 6.8% after the company reported first-quarter earnings and sales that missed expectations. It also cut its quarterly dividend.

Viking Therapeutics Inc. shares VKTX, -3.60% slid 7%. The company reported positive results in a midstage trial of a treatment for broken hips.

Shares of Facebook Inc. FB, +1.40% fell 1.2%. The social-media giant had seen its shares slump on Friday, too, after an announcement that hackers had compromised the accounts of more than 50 million users. A European Union privacy watchdog could fine the company as much as $1.63 billion for the data breach.

Stock Gains Fade As Dow Jones Average Leads Mixed SessionStock Gains Fade As Dow Jones Average Leads Mixed Session,"The major stock indexes closed higher Monday but reversed in the afternoon to wipe out much of the morning gains. The Dow Jones average held most of its gain, ending the first trading session of the new quarter up 0.7%.

The fade was most noticeable on the Nasdaq, which was up as much as 0.8% but closed with a loss of 0.1%. The S&P 500 also pared gains and ended 0.4% higher.

Among stocks in the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, Boeing (BA) climbed past the 374.58 entry of a flat base in active trading. Boeing, another trade-sensitive stock, had already cleared the 364.64 correct buy point of a base within the larger pattern.

Dow Jones Leader

Boeing, now up 29.6% since Jan. 1, is a member of IBD Leaderboard.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see the jet maker's earnings rising 30% to $3.54 a share. Boeing has posted strong earnings increases for three straight quarters. Full-year profit is seen up 20% to $14.64 a share.

Small caps struggled, with the Russell 2000 off 1.5% at the closing bell. Volumes rose from Friday's levels, according to early data.

Stocks opened higher after Canadian negotiators late Sunday agreed to join a trade accord with the U.S. and Mexico.

Canadian National Railway (CNI) broke out of a base-on-base pattern. It topped the 90.67 buy point in heavy trading. Shares gapped up, a bullish sign, although the relative strength line has not made a new high. Ideally the RS line would make a new high to solidify the breakout.

Canadian oil company Encana (ECA) rose past the 13.59 proper buy point of a double-bottom base but closed slightly below that. Encana announced today that a subsidiary is selling assets in New Mexico for $480 million to Denver-based DJR Energy.

Besides Dow Jones Names, Energy Stocks Also Lead Upside

A few other energy stocks broke out as well. Continental Resources (CLR) rose above the 70.01 buy point of an undefined base. Shares closed 3% higher and volume was merely average. The RS line has not made a new high.

Auto manufacturers were Monday's best-performing industry group after Tesla (TSLA) shares surged 17% Monday.

Over the weekend, the automaker and CEO Elon Musk reached a settlement with the Securities & Exchange Commission in which Musk will step down as chairman but will keep his CEO title. Musk and Tesla also must each pay $20 million fines and must add two new members to the board. The pact settles a lawsuit that the SEC filed against the company and its CEO over Musk's tweets announcing plans to take the company private.

The stock is attempting to climb back above the 50-day moving average, not that a move above the line would matter much. The stock has been volatile and not behaving well enough to identify a proper follow-on entry.

Meanwhile, President Trump hailed the North American trade deal as a boon to the U.S. auto industry.

Former Dow component General Electric (GE) jumped 7% after paring gains. GE dismissed its top executive, John Flannery, on Monday after little more than a year on the job. Director Lawrence Culp was named chairman and chief executive. GE also announced a big charge for a troubled business and issued a profit warning.

"Apple Raises Dow Jones, Tilray Up; 5 Top Growth Stocks Hit This Sell Signal","The Dow Jones industrial average led a large-cap advance in stocks today, rising nearly 1% and nearly wiping out last week's 1.1% drop. The Dow's strong start in October follows news late Sunday that the U.S. and Canadian trade negotiators ended weeks of wrangling on import tariffs and barriers regarding dairy products and cars.

X

But both sides reportedly have not lifted any tariffs on steel and other products. Small cap stocks, meanwhile, weakened.

At noon time in New York, as many as 13 components with the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1 point or more, including leading stock Boeing (BA). The aerospace giant, a new member of IBD Leaderboard, rose more than 8 points, or 2.3%, to move further past a 364.64 early buy point in a flat base.

That base is lodged inside a longer base. Boeing is also rising past a 374.58 conventional buy point in a three-month flat base.

The Nasdaq composite lagged, up less than 0.5%. Yet the tech-rich index still leads in year-to-date performance, up 17.1%. The Dow, at 26,699, holds an 8% year-to-date gain.

The S&P 500 rallied around 0.6%. Automaker, dairy, movie, rail transport and oil shares paced the upside.

The Dow Jones transportation average gained more than 0.7%. Small caps lost some luster. The Russell 2000 sank 0.4%. Volume is running higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Friday.

The S&P MidCap 400 reversed from an early-morning lift of 0.5% to fall 0.3%. The index is fighting to hold above the 50-day moving average for the past four trading sessions. At 2013, the 400 remains a lagging index, up 5.9% since Jan. 1.

Active Trading Still Outperforms Passive Indexes

The IBD Mutual Fund Index, updated each day in the General Market Indicators chart PDF at the bottom of the daily Big Picture column, shows a 14.7% advance since Jan. 1. The index is composed of 20 top-performing actively managed mutual funds.

Pot stock Tilray (TLRY) gapped up more than 18% to 170.41, notching its highest level since its hairpin dive on Sept. 20. The company's High Park Farms subsidiary received a sales license from Canada's public health agency.

Tilray is just beginning to form a 50-day moving average, which is currently near 67. Watch for a new base to potentially form.

Tesla (TSLA) also regained some mojo with a 16% jump to 307.28 on news that CEO Elon Musk and the Securities & Exchange Commission have settled securities fraud charges.

Both Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million fines each, and the highly regarded entrepreneur will vacate the chairman post.

Tesla shares are still rangebound. The stock still faces a test of upside resistance near the 50-day moving average and are 20% below a 52-week peak. Wall Street expects the EV pioneer to post a profit of $2.83 a share in 2019.

Apple Helps Dow Jones Firm Up

Apple (AAPL) is also leading the Dow Jones industrials, making a fifth advance in the past six sessions. Shares of the iPhone, wearables, MacBook and digital services giant rallied more than 1.3% to 228.68. The stock is close to breaching its all-time high of 229.67.

Shares have issued an offense-type sell signal ó that is, for those who bought at the 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom on May 4 or soon after, Apple has now achieved a 25% profit.

Analysts expect fiscal Q4 profit to climb 34% to $2.77 a share.

Apple has grown earnings 2%, 11%, 18%, 24%, 16%, 30% and 40% vs. year-ago levels in the past seven quarters.

Higher-priced growth stocks generally backtracked, but few were issuing defensive sell signals.

4 More Stocks Hit An Offense-Type Profit-Taking Level

Match Group (MTCH), Veeva Systems (VEEV), Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) and Roku (ROKU) have also gained more than 20% to 25% past their respective breakout points, justifying at least partial profit taking.

Match Group, which owns the Tinder dating app, is making big strides in the university and Japan markets. The stock cleared a 48.75 entry in a unusual-looking cup base on Aug. 9 following blistering Q2 results (earnings up 156% to 41 cents a share, revenue up 36% to $421.2 million). Shares have since risen 25% before pulling back a tad.

Those with either strong conviction or a huge profit cushion could decide to either hold a full position and wait for a potential base to form. Or they could sell some shares and sit on the rest of the position until a key defense-type sell signal triggers, or more than one sell signal hits the stock chart simultaneously.

The Street sees Match Group's profit rising 117% this year to $1.41 a share, then lifting another 22% to $1.72 in 2019.

CarGurus Stock Reverses

Midcap growth stock leader CarGurus (CARG), is not issuing any IBD defense-type sell signal for now, even though shares fell as much as 5% and dived beneath a 53.41 buy point in a narrow cup with handle. CarGurus is also a new stock on IBD Leaderboard.

One key sell rule: Lock in gains when a stock pierces through the 50-day or 10-week moving average and fails to rebound quickly.

A second rule: Keep all losses small.

The online marketplace for cars has grown earnings per share by 25%, 50% and 50% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters. The Street sees Q3 profit up 150% to 5 cents a share and full-year earnings up 53% to 23 cents.

CarGurus has 109 million shares outstanding and a market value of almost $6 billion.

Oil Prices Keep Rising

WTI near-term crude oil futures are also having a brilliant start to the new month, rising 2% to $74.72 a barrel. That's the highest level since November 2014.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 2 basis points to 3.07%. The yield got closer to a May 17 peak of 3.11%.

The ISM manufacturing survey, announced Monday morning, reaffirmed busy activity among U.S. factories. The September reading was solid at 59.8. That slightly missed the 59.9 consensus forecast from Econoday.

"Boeing's stock delivers 60-point jolt to Dow industrials as Trump heralds revised trade deal with Canada, Mexico","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading near session highs late-morning Monday as an 11th-hour agreement with Canada paved the way to a revised Nafta agreement, with shares of Boeing Co., delivering the lion's share of gains for the blue-chip index. Shares of Boeing BA, +2.72% up $9.06, or 2.4%, were contributing more than 60 points to the Dow's DJIA, -0.11% advance on Monday. Multinational companies like Boeing, which tend to be the most vulnerable to trade disputes between the U.S., Canada, and China, for example. A $1 move in any one of the Dow's 30 components equates to a 6.8-point swing in the price-weighted gauge. President Donald Trump during an 11 a.m. Eastern Time news conference in the Rose Garden described the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, referred to as USMCA, or the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, was a ""truly historic"" agreement.

Dow Jones Futures Up On U.S.-Canada Trade Deal; Tesla Stock Jumps On SEC Settlement,"Dow Jones futures rose strongly Monday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, on a tentative U.S.-Canada trade deal. That should be good news for General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F). Tesla stock is skyrocketing after the SEC settled with Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk. Musk will step down as chairman for at least three years but he can stay on the board and remain CEO. Elon Musk and Tesla will each pay a $20 million penalty. Meanwhile, hot recent IPO Stitch Fix (SFIX) reports earnings Monday.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Signaling strong gains to start the fourth quarter, Dow Jones futures climbed 0.8% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.75% above fair value. Remember that Dow futures and other overnight action don't necessarily translate in actual trading in the next regular session.

U.S.-Canada Trade Deal

Dow futures expanded gains on word that a U.S.-Canada trade talks finally finished with a revised Nafta deal. The U.S. and Canada confirmed the agreement shortly before America's midnight ET deadline. The U.S., Canada and Mexico will revise Nafta, which will be renamed the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement (USMCA).

Canada gave concessions on its dairy market, a sore spot for President Donald Trump. The countries did keep a key dispute mechanism, a win for Canada.

A U.S.-Canada trade accord should ease investor fears. President Trump had threatened to send a bilateral U.S.-Mexico trade deal to Congress with Canada excluded. A continued North America trade deal, even if many experts say the revisions are a net negative, should be good news for automakers, notably GM and Ford. GM stock hit a 16-month last week amid Trump trade war fears and signs of weakening industry sales. Ford stock sank to a 6-year low. Both GM and Ford rose more than 1% before the open on the stock market today.

However, a revised North American trade deal could make it less likely to reach a China trade war peace deal. With North America supply chains still together, the U.S. is at less risk from escalating the China trade war.

SEC Tesla Settlement Boosts Tesla Stock

Tesla stock roared 16% higher to 306.95 early Monday. On Friday, Tesla stock crashed 14% after the SEC sued Elon Musk, accusing him of fraud over his go-private, ""funding secured"" claims back in August. The SEC lawsuit had sought to bar Elon Musk from serving as an officer or director of any company. Wall Street saw Elon Musk's ouster as devastating for Tesla's stock.

That lawsuit and the Tesla stock plunge, apparently spurred Elon Musk to settle, after reportedly rejecting another SEC deal earlier in the week.

This could be a best-possible scenario for Tesla investors. Tesla gets a modest fine. Musk is still CEO, but he'll lose a little control. Someone else will be chairman and the board must add two more independent directors. Plus, Musk must hire an ""experienced securities lawyer"" to vet future tweets.

Still, the SEC-Tesla settlement, and information that the SEC disclosed, will help an ongoing Justice Department probe and shareholder lawsuits. Anyone who was shorting Tesla stock and covered after Elon Musk's infamous go-private ""funding secured"" tweet on Aug. 7 has a strong case. So do investors who bought Tesla stock as result of the go-private effort.

Tesla Model 3 Output Figures

Meanwhile, early this week Tesla should report third-quarter production and delivery figures. Tesla Model 3 output should be 50,000-55,000 in Q3, the company says, with Model 3 deliveries of 55,000 or more. Electrek reported on Friday that Tesla Model 3 output had topped 51,000.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk has admitted trouble getting Model 3 sedans to customers, citing ""delivery logistics hell.""

In a leaked email to Tesla staff, Elon Musk said the company is ""very close"" to profitability. Musk had said he expected profitability in the third quarter. Sustained profitability and positive cash flow is key, because Tesla's cash levels have been dwindling.

Tesla Stock Chart

Perhaps this is the moment that everything starts turning around for Tesla and the stock. But investors are more likely to be successful looking for solidly profitable companies whose stocks are setting up in bullish bases.

For all the talk of Tesla's big run since its IPO, most of those gains came from an April 2013 breakout to early 2014. Actually, Tesla stock closed Friday at 264.22, below its February 2014 peak of 265.

Tesla's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a 21-month low. The RS line should rise some with Tesla shares Monday. But the stock chart is not pretty.

Stitch Fix Earnings

Stitch Fix earnings are due after Monday's market close. Analysts expect fiscal Q4 earnings per share of 4 cents on revenue of $319 million. The online retailer's subscription business selects and delivers apparel to customers. A November 2017 IPO at 15 a share, Stitch Fix stock has soared this year, closing Friday at 43.82.

"Dow Stocks: Apple Stock, Microsoft Stock Walgreens Stock Top Dow Performers In Q3","The Dow Jones industrial average led the way in the third quarter. The blue-chip index in July pivoted from the choppy action of the first half of the year and into a clear uptrend. The top five Dow stocks of the quarter were: Apple (AAPL), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Microsoft (MSFT). Apple stock and Microsoft stock are two of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization.

X

Apple Stock

Apple stock likely has the most compelling chart action of the top Dow stocks. The tech giant is presenting a buying opportunity as it rebounds off the 10-week line for the first time since its August breakout. The first two pullbacks to the 10-week line after a breakout are considered chances to add shares to a position.

Apple stock popped 22% in Q3, more than any other Dow stock. The bulk of that came in August, when shares ran up nearly 20% following strong Apple earnings on July 31.

After another week of trading action, we could see a new chart pattern with a 229.77 buy point. But Apple stock has not yet met the minimum-length requirement for the formation of a proper base.

Apple stock rose 0.9% before the open in Monday's stock market trading.

Walgreens Stock

It might come as a surprise that Walgreens Boots Alliance was one of the top Dow Jones industrial average stocks of Q3, given that it's essentially flat for the year. But in the third quarter the drugstore chain surged 21.5%. Even with the strong gains, Walgreens stock has not yet presented a buying opportunity this year.

The SEC on Friday fined Walgreens Boots Alliance $34.5 million, saying its former CEO and CFO ""misled investors about the company's public financial goal"" over multiple reporting periods prior to the close of its 2014 merger with Alliance Boots. Walgreens in its settlement with the SEC says it ""neither admits nor denies"" the allegations.

When Walgreens issues its quarterly report on Oct. 11, analysts expect earnings growth of 11% on 12% sales growth. That would mark deceleration from the prior quarter.

Walgreens stock was little changed early Monday.

Pfizer Stock

After reporting accelerating quarterly earnings and sales growth in late July, drugmaker Pfizer broke out of a six-month-long consolidation in heavy volume. Pfizer stock is now extended 12% from the 39.53 entry, rising 21.5% for the quarter. The Dow stock is now nearing its all-time high from 1999 after trading essentially sideways for several years.

Pfizer said early Monday that CEO Ian Read will step down by year-end. Albert Bourla will replace him. Pfizer stock edged higher before the open.

Merck Stock

Dow Jones industrial average member Merck stock has similar chart action to its drugmaker peer Pfizer. Shares in recent months broke above yearslong sideways action and are headed toward old highs. But unlike Pfizer stock, Merck stock has not presented a buying opportunity this year.

And, while Pfizer's relative strength line is at a near-term high, Merck's RS line is lagging its Aug. 20 peak despite trading at a higher share price. Still, Merck stock gained 16.9% in Q3.

Merck rose a fraction early Monday.

Microsoft Stock

Lastly, Microsoft stock climbed 16% in the third quarter, and is extended 18% from a flat base that it shaped in Q2. The Dow stock has found support at its 50-day line multiple times along its run. Microsoft is now the third largest company by market cap, behind Apple and Amazon (AMZN), passing Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) several months ago to earn that designation.

Microsoft rose slightly before the open.

Dow Jones Industrial Average: Top Dow Stocks

As of Friday's close, the Dow Jones industrial average in Q3 gained 9%, outpacing gains of about 7% for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Dow stocks Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Visa (V) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also turned in notable performances over the past three months.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks"
3 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy Today,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is entering the new week with what is undoubtedly the cleanest bull retracement pattern of the year. Hungry dip buyers were salivating all weekend long in anticipation of a potentially profitable meal. And if you‚Äôve seen what Dow Jones stocks are doing this morning, then you know these hopes were not in vain.

Large-cap stocks are leading the charge delivering a quick 1% gain to the Dow right out of the gate. What‚Äôs perhaps most impressive is the rally comes while the Russell 2000 is falling 0.30% marking some severe divergence between large and small caps. The beauty of last week‚Äôs mild retracement and today‚Äôs pole vault is that many Dow Jones stocks are flashing attractive entry points.

I‚Äôve scoured the entire Index and here are three of the best Dow Jones stocks to buy.

American Express (AXP)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

American Express (NYSE: AXP ) enters the new week having fallen five of the past six trading sessions. The retreat came after AXP stock notched a new record high at $111.77. Shorting a stock after a multi-day retracement from all-time highs has got to be one of the dumbest ideas I can think of. It‚Äôs the ultimate low probability play.

And that means doing the opposite is smart. Buying dips in an uptrend, particularly one that just surged in momentum like AXP, means you have the wind at your back. And with the stock already down a few percent from the highs, you‚Äôre getting a nice discount. Furthermore, we‚Äôre now much closer to support levels suggesting the risk is minimal if the setup doesn‚Äôt work.

Sell the Nov $105/$100 put spread for 97 cents.

Exxon Mobil (XOM)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

Oil prices are making a comeback, and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) shares are loving it. After carving out a low near $76 in mid-August, XOM stock rallied uninterrupted to $87. The ascent saw a groundswell in accumulation days signaling institutions were entering the fray.

Last week‚Äôs four-day pullback marks the first quality buying opportunity arising in the oil giant in two months. And I think it‚Äôs an opportunity worth pouncing on. If the slide persists many support levels loom close including old resistance near $84.50 and the rising 20-day moving average.

To build out a high probability of profit, consider selling the Nov $82.50/$77.50 put spread for 70 cents. If XOM stock sits above $82.50 at expiration, you‚Äôll capture the max reward of 70 cents. The initial cost is $4.30.

Boeing (BA)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

Boeing (NYSE: BA ) rounds out today‚Äôs trio with a picture perfect breakout play. This morning‚Äôs 2.5% takeoff is officially carrying BA stock above major long-term resistance, completing an eight-month base. The expression, ‚Äúthe longer the base, the higher in space‚Äù comes to mind here. Given the dominance and duration of Boeing‚Äôs trading range this year, the importance of today‚Äôs breakout can‚Äôt be overstated.

It marks the beginning of the stock‚Äôs next leg higher and an easy entry point for spectators looking for an excuse to climb aboard finally.

Buy the Nov $380/$400 bull call spread for $8.

Dow's nearly 280-point surge puts it on track for best day in more than 6 weeks,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday jumped more than 270 points, putting the blue-chip gauge on track for its best day in six weeks, as Wall Street rallied as the U.S. and Canada forged an 11th hour deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Dow DJIA, -0.11% was up 277 points, or 1%, at 26,733, not far from a new peak for the gauge. An advance of this magnitude, if it holds, would represent the best daily rally for the Dow since Aug. 16 when the index surged 396 points or 1.6%. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% also were driven solidly higher, with the S&P 500 also trading near records. President Donald Trump was set to hold a news conference in the Rose Garden to discuss the updated Nafta accord at 11 a.m. Eastern Time, coming just days after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Congress that the two countries were unlikely to meet that deadline for a pact. The Nafta pact must still be approved by Congress.

"Dow ends about 190 points higher, S&P 500 closes near record as Nafta deal sparks rally","The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday finished the session with a triple-digit advance and the S&P 500 flirted with a fresh all-time high to start the first day of October and the fourth quarter after the U.S. and Canada reached an 11th-hour deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index sat out the day's rally, ending lower on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% rose 193 points, or 0.7%, to reach 26,651, powered by shares of Boeing Co., which delivered a nearly 70-point jolt to the price-weighted blue-chip index. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% closed up 0.4% at 2,924, less than a half-percent short of its Sept. 20 closing high at 2,930.75, while the Nasdaq COMP, -0.25% finished down 0.1% at 8,037. All three benchmarks finished off their best levels of the day. The North American Trade Agreement forged with Canada, brings the U.S.'s northern neighbor into a new trilateral agreement that Mexico had agreed to weeks ago. The deal, known now as the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA, must still be approved by Congress but was heralded by President Donald Trump as a ""historic news."" Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 index RUT, -0.33% of small-capitalization companies, fell 1.5% to end at 1,673, marking its worst day since July 27th, according to FactSet data. The index has been a respite for investors hoping to lessen the impact of trade on their holdings because the revenue of its constituents aren't directly hurt by trade because they tend to be domestically driven. In corporate news, shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.93% jumped after Chairman and Chief Executive Elon Musk settled a Securities and Exchange fraud probe over the weekend and said the company was nearing profitability, while shares of General Electric GE, +2.58% jumped after after the troubled industrial conglomerate said its chief executive officer, John Flannery, was being replaced after a little over a year in the role.

Stocks close mostly higher on new U.S.-Canada Nafta deal,"U.S. stocks closed mostly higher, but off the best levels Monday, after the U.S. and Canada reached a deal to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. The news helped to alleviate some of the concerns surrounding trade that have periodically weighed on the market over the past several months.

How did major benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% gained 192.90 points, or 0.7%, to 26,651.21 and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.22% advanced 10.61 points, or 0.4%, to 2,924.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% meanwhile, reversed direction to fall 9.05 points, or 0.1%, to 8,037.30.

What drove trading?

The fourth quarter‚Äôs opening session kicked off with an unexpected breakthrough in U.S.- Canada trade negotiations. In a news conference, President Donald Trump called the deal ‚Äútruly historic.‚Äù Among other changes, the deal for the first time sets rules for categories of financial-services and digital businesses that have emerged since the bloc was created.

The development came just four days after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had told Congress that chances were slim that a Canada deal would be reached in time to meet a U.S.-imposed deadline.

In the latest economic data, a reading on U.S. manufacturing from Markit came in at 55.6, compared with a previous reading of 54.7, while a reading on manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management came in at 59.8, slightly below expectations.

Investors also kept an eye on Europe after Italy‚Äôs antiestablishment government significantly widened its budget-deficit target for next year, potentially setting the country on a collision course with the European Union.

In the U.K., the Conservatives‚Äô annual party conference was getting under way with Prime Minister Theresa May facing pressure over her proposal for future U.K.-EU relations, known as the Chequers plan, which has already been rejected by EU leaders.

What were analysts saying?

‚ÄúAlthough the trade outlook with China remains uncertain, overall trade uncertainty has been receding for months, helping propel stocks to record highs,‚Äù said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. ‚ÄúAnd even when it comes to China many investors are betting there‚Äôs room for a market friendly compromise.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúInternational stocks have even more to gain from trade breakthroughs than their U.S. counterparts because they have been held back too far by trade worries due to their economies‚Äô increased sensitivity to trade.‚Äù

What stocks were in focus?

Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.93% jumped 17% after Chairman and Chief Executive Elon Musk settled a Securities and Exchange fraud probe.

The stock had dropped more than 25% thus far this year.

Pfizer Inc. PFE, +1.36% said that Chief Executive Officer Ian Read plans to step aside at the end of the year, and will hand the reins to deputy Albert Bourla. Shares of the Dow component were up 0.5%.

Cal-Maine Foods Inc. CALM, -1.55% tumbled 6.8% after the company reported first-quarter earnings and sales that missed expectations. It also cut its quarterly dividend.

Viking Therapeutics Inc. shares VKTX, -3.60% slid 7%. The company reported positive results in a midstage trial of a treatment for broken hips.

Shares of Facebook Inc. FB, +1.40% fell 1.2%. The social-media giant had seen its shares slump on Friday, too, after an announcement that hackers had compromised the accounts of more than 50 million users.

Canadian oil company Encana (ECA) rose past the 13.59 proper buy point of a double-bottom base but closed slightly below that. Encana announced today that a subsidiary is selling assets in New Mexico for $480 million to Denver-based DJR Energy.

Besides Dow Jones Names, Energy Stocks Also Lead Upside

A few other energy stocks broke out as well. Continental Resources (CLR) rose above the 70.01 buy point of an undefined base. Shares closed 3% higher and volume was merely average. The RS line has not made a new high.

Auto manufacturers were Monday's best-performing industry group after Tesla (TSLA) shares surged 17% Monday.

Over the weekend, the automaker and CEO Elon Musk reached a settlement with the Securities & Exchange Commission in which Musk will step down as chairman but will keep his CEO title. Musk and Tesla also must each pay $20 million fines and must add two new members to the board. The pact settles a lawsuit that the SEC filed against the company and its CEO over Musk's tweets announcing plans to take the company private.

The stock is attempting to climb back above the 50-day moving average, not that a move above the line would matter much. The stock has been volatile and not behaving well enough to identify a proper follow-on entry.

Meanwhile, President Trump hailed the North American trade deal as a boon to the U.S. auto industry.

Former Dow component General Electric (GE) jumped 7% after paring gains. GE dismissed its top executive, John Flannery, on Monday after little more than a year on the job. Director Lawrence Culp was named chairman and chief executive. GE also announced a big charge for a troubled business and issued a profit warning.

"Apple Raises Dow Jones, Tilray Up; 5 Top Growth Stocks Hit This Sell Signal","The Dow Jones industrial average led a large-cap advance in stocks today, rising nearly 1% and nearly wiping out last week's 1.1% drop. The Dow's strong start in October follows news late Sunday that the U.S. and Canadian trade negotiators ended weeks of wrangling on import tariffs and barriers regarding dairy products and cars.

X

But both sides reportedly have not lifted any tariffs on steel and other products. Small cap stocks, meanwhile, weakened.

At noon time in New York, as many as 13 components with the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1 point or more, including leading stock Boeing (BA). The aerospace giant, a new member of IBD Leaderboard, rose more than 8 points, or 2.3%, to move further past a 364.64 early buy point in a flat base.

That base is lodged inside a longer base. Boeing is also rising past a 374.58 conventional buy point in a three-month flat base.

The Nasdaq composite lagged, up less than 0.5%. Yet the tech-rich index still leads in year-to-date performance, up 17.1%. The Dow, at 26,699, holds an 8% year-to-date gain.

The S&P 500 rallied around 0.6%. Automaker, dairy, movie, rail transport and oil shares paced the upside.

The Dow Jones transportation average gained more than 0.7%. Small caps lost some luster. The Russell 2000 sank 0.4%. Volume is running higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Friday.

The S&P MidCap 400 reversed from an early-morning lift of 0.5% to fall 0.3%. The index is fighting to hold above the 50-day moving average for the past four trading sessions. At 2013, the 400 remains a lagging index, up 5.9% since Jan. 1.

Active Trading Still Outperforms Passive Indexes

The IBD Mutual Fund Index, updated each day in the General Market Indicators chart PDF at the bottom of the daily Big Picture column, shows a 14.7% advance since Jan. 1. The index is composed of 20 top-performing actively managed mutual funds.

Pot stock Tilray (TLRY) gapped up more than 18% to 170.41, notching its highest level since its hairpin dive on Sept. 20. The company's High Park Farms subsidiary received a sales license from Canada's public health agency.

Tilray is just beginning to form a 50-day moving average, which is currently near 67. Watch for a new base to potentially form.

Tesla (TSLA) also regained some mojo with a 16% jump to 307.28 on news that CEO Elon Musk and the Securities & Exchange Commission have settled securities fraud charges.

Both Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million fines each, and the highly regarded entrepreneur will vacate the chairman post.

Tesla shares are still rangebound. The stock still faces a test of upside resistance near the 50-day moving average and are 20% below a 52-week peak. Wall Street expects the EV pioneer to post a profit of $2.83 a share in 2019.

Apple Helps Dow Jones Firm Up

Apple (AAPL) is also leading the Dow Jones industrials, making a fifth advance in the past six sessions. Shares of the iPhone, wearables, MacBook and digital services giant rallied more than 1.3% to 228.68. The stock is close to breaching its all-time high of 229.67.

Shares have issued an offense-type sell signal ‚Äî that is, for those who bought at the 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom on May 4 or soon after, Apple has now achieved a 25% profit.

Analysts expect fiscal Q4 profit to climb 34% to $2.77 a share.

Apple has grown earnings 2%, 11%, 18%, 24%, 16%, 30% and 40% vs. year-ago levels in the past seven quarters.

Higher-priced growth stocks generally backtracked, but few were issuing defensive sell signals.

4 More Stocks Hit An Offense-Type Profit-Taking Level

Match Group (MTCH), Veeva Systems (VEEV), Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) and Roku (ROKU) have also gained more than 20% to 25% past their respective breakout points, justifying at least partial profit taking.

Match Group, which owns the Tinder dating app, is making big strides in the university and Japan markets. The stock cleared a 48.75 entry in a unusual-looking cup base on Aug. 9 following blistering Q2 results (earnings up 156% to 41 cents a share, revenue up 36% to $421.2 million). Shares have since risen 25% before pulling back a tad.

Those with either strong conviction or a huge profit cushion could decide to either hold a full position and wait for a potential base to form. Or they could sell some shares and sit on the rest of the position until a key defense-type sell signal triggers, or more than one sell signal hits the stock chart simultaneously.

The Street sees Match Group's profit rising 117% this year to $1.41 a share, then lifting another 22% to $1.72 in 2019.

CarGurus Stock Reverses

Midcap growth stock leader CarGurus (CARG), is not issuing any IBD defense-type sell signal for now, even though shares fell as much as 5% and dived beneath a 53.41 buy point in a narrow cup with handle. CarGurus is also a new stock on IBD Leaderboard.

One key sell rule: Lock in gains when a stock pierces through the 50-day or 10-week moving average and fails to rebound quickly.

A second rule: Keep all losses small.

The online marketplace for cars has grown earnings per share by 25%, 50% and 50% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters. The Street sees Q3 profit up 150% to 5 cents a share and full-year earnings up 53% to 23 cents.

CarGurus has 109 million shares outstanding and a market value of almost $6 billion.

Oil Prices Keep Rising

WTI near-term crude oil futures are also having a brilliant start to the new month, rising 2% to $74.72 a barrel. That's the highest level since November 2014.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 2 basis points to 3.07%. The yield got closer to a May 17 peak of 3.11%.

The ISM manufacturing survey, announced Monday morning, reaffirmed busy activity among U.S. factories. The September reading was solid at 59.8. That slightly missed the 59.9 consensus forecast from Econoday.

"Boeing's stock delivers 60-point jolt to Dow industrials as Trump heralds revised trade deal with Canada, Mexico","The Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading near session highs late-morning Monday as an 11th-hour agreement with Canada paved the way to a revised Nafta agreement, with shares of Boeing Co., delivering the lion's share of gains for the blue-chip index.

Multinational companies like Boeing, which tend to be the most vulnerable to trade disputes between the U.S., Canada, and China, for example.

Dow Jones Futures Up On U.S.-Canada Trade Deal; Tesla Stock Jumps On SEC Settlement,"Dow Jones futures rose strongly Monday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, on a tentative U.S.-Canada trade deal. That should be good news for General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F). Tesla stock is skyrocketing after the SEC settled with Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk. Musk will step down as chairman for at least three years but he can stay on the board and remain CEO. Elon Musk and Tesla will each pay a $20 million penalty. Meanwhile, hot recent IPO Stitch Fix (SFIX) reports earnings Monday.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Signaling strong gains to start the fourth quarter, Dow Jones futures climbed 0.8% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.75% above fair value. Remember that Dow futures and other overnight action don't necessarily translate in actual trading in the next regular session.

U.S.-Canada Trade Deal

Dow futures expanded gains on word that a U.S.-Canada trade talks finally finished with a revised Nafta deal. The U.S. and Canada confirmed the agreement shortly before America's midnight ET deadline. The U.S., Canada and Mexico will revise Nafta, which will be renamed the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement (USMCA).

Canada gave concessions on its dairy market, a sore spot for President Donald Trump. The countries did keep a key dispute mechanism, a win for Canada.

A U.S.-Canada trade accord should ease investor fears. President Trump had threatened to send a bilateral U.S.-Mexico trade deal to Congress with Canada excluded. A continued North America trade deal, even if many experts say the revisions are a net negative, should be good news for automakers, notably GM and Ford. GM stock hit a 16-month last week amid Trump trade war fears and signs of weakening industry sales. Ford stock sank to a 6-year low. Both GM and Ford rose more than 1% before the open on the stock market today.

However, a revised North American trade deal could make it less likely to reach a China trade war peace deal. With North America supply chains still together, the U.S. is at less risk from escalating the China trade war.

SEC Tesla Settlement Boosts Tesla Stock

Tesla stock roared 16% higher to 306.95 early Monday. On Friday, Tesla stock crashed 14% after the SEC sued Elon Musk, accusing him of fraud over his go-private, ""funding secured"" claims back in August. The SEC lawsuit had sought to bar Elon Musk from serving as an officer or director of any company. Wall Street saw Elon Musk's ouster as devastating for Tesla's stock.

That lawsuit and the Tesla stock plunge, apparently spurred Elon Musk to settle, after reportedly rejecting another SEC deal earlier in the week.

This could be a best-possible scenario for Tesla investors. Tesla gets a modest fine. Musk is still CEO, but he'll lose a little control. Someone else will be chairman and the board must add two more independent directors. Plus, Musk must hire an ""experienced securities lawyer"" to vet future tweets.

Still, the SEC-Tesla settlement, and information that the SEC disclosed, will help an ongoing Justice Department probe and shareholder lawsuits. Anyone who was shorting Tesla stock and covered after Elon Musk's infamous go-private ""funding secured"" tweet on Aug. 7 has a strong case. So do investors who bought Tesla stock as result of the go-private effort.

Tesla Model 3 Output Figures

Meanwhile, early this week Tesla should report third-quarter production and delivery figures. Tesla Model 3 output should be 50,000-55,000 in Q3, the company says, with Model 3 deliveries of 55,000 or more. Electrek reported on Friday that Tesla Model 3 output had topped 51,000.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk has admitted trouble getting Model 3 sedans to customers, citing ""delivery logistics hell.""

In a leaked email to Tesla staff, Elon Musk said the company is ""very close"" to profitability. Musk had said he expected profitability in the third quarter. Sustained profitability and positive cash flow is key, because Tesla's cash levels have been dwindling.

Tesla Stock Chart

Perhaps this is the moment that everything starts turning around for Tesla and the stock. But investors are more likely to be successful looking for solidly profitable companies whose stocks are setting up in bullish bases.

For all the talk of Tesla's big run since its IPO, most of those gains came from an April 2013 breakout to early 2014. Actually, Tesla stock closed Friday at 264.22, below its February 2014 peak of 265.

Tesla's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a 21-month low. The RS line should rise some with Tesla shares Monday. But the stock chart is not pretty.

Stitch Fix Earnings

Stitch Fix earnings are due after Monday's market close. Analysts expect fiscal Q4 earnings per share of 4 cents on revenue of $319 million. The online retailer's subscription business selects and delivers apparel to customers. A November 2017 IPO at 15 a share, Stitch Fix stock has soared this year, closing Friday at 43.82.

"Dow Stocks: Apple Stock, Microsoft Stock Walgreens Stock Top Dow Performers In Q3","The Dow Jones industrial average led the way in the third quarter. The blue-chip index in July pivoted from the choppy action of the first half of the year and into a clear uptrend. The top five Dow stocks of the quarter were: Apple (AAPL), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Microsoft (MSFT). Apple stock and Microsoft stock are two of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization.

X

Apple Stock

Apple stock likely has the most compelling chart action of the top Dow stocks. The tech giant is presenting a buying opportunity as it rebounds off the 10-week line for the first time since its August breakout. The first two pullbacks to the 10-week line after a breakout are considered chances to add shares to a position.

Apple stock popped 22% in Q3, more than any other Dow stock. The bulk of that came in August, when shares ran up nearly 20% following strong Apple earnings on July 31.

After another week of trading action, we could see a new chart pattern with a 229.77 buy point. But Apple stock has not yet met the minimum-length requirement for the formation of a proper base.

Apple stock rose 0.9% before the open in Monday's stock market trading.

Walgreens Stock

It might come as a surprise that Walgreens Boots Alliance was one of the top Dow Jones industrial average stocks of Q3, given that it's essentially flat for the year. But in the third quarter the drugstore chain surged 21.5%. Even with the strong gains, Walgreens stock has not yet presented a buying opportunity this year.

The SEC on Friday fined Walgreens Boots Alliance $34.5 million, saying its former CEO and CFO ""misled investors about the company's public financial goal"" over multiple reporting periods prior to the close of its 2014 merger with Alliance Boots. Walgreens in its settlement with the SEC says it ""neither admits nor denies"" the allegations.

When Walgreens issues its quarterly report on Oct. 11, analysts expect earnings growth of 11% on 12% sales growth. That would mark deceleration from the prior quarter.

Walgreens stock was little changed early Monday.

Pfizer Stock

After reporting accelerating quarterly earnings and sales growth in late July, drugmaker Pfizer broke out of a six-month-long consolidation in heavy volume. Pfizer stock is now extended 12% from the 39.53 entry, rising 21.5% for the quarter. The Dow stock is now nearing its all-time high from 1999 after trading essentially sideways for several years.

Pfizer said early Monday that CEO Ian Read will step down by year-end. Albert Bourla will replace him. Pfizer stock edged higher before the open.

Merck Stock

Dow Jones industrial average member Merck stock has similar chart action to its drugmaker peer Pfizer. Shares in recent months broke above yearslong sideways action and are headed toward old highs. But unlike Pfizer stock, Merck stock has not presented a buying opportunity this year.

And, while Pfizer's relative strength line is at a near-term high, Merck's RS line is lagging its Aug. 20 peak despite trading at a higher share price. Still, Merck stock gained 16.9% in Q3.

Merck rose a fraction early Monday.

Microsoft Stock

Lastly, Microsoft stock climbed 16% in the third quarter, and is extended 18% from a flat base that it shaped in Q2. The Dow stock has found support at its 50-day line multiple times along its run. Microsoft is now the third largest company by market cap, behind Apple and Amazon (AMZN), passing Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) several months ago to earn that designation.

Microsoft rose slightly before the open.

Dow Jones Industrial Average: Top Dow Stocks

As of Friday's close, the Dow Jones industrial average in Q3 gained 9%, outpacing gains of about 7% for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Dow stocks Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Visa (V) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also turned in notable performances over the past three months.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks"
3 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy Today,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is entering the new week with what is undoubtedly the cleanest bull retracement pattern of the year. Hungry dip buyers were salivating all weekend long in anticipation of a potentially profitable meal. And if you‚Äôve seen what Dow Jones stocks are doing this morning, then you know these hopes were not in vain.

Large-cap stocks are leading the charge delivering a quick 1% gain to the Dow right out of the gate. What‚Äôs perhaps most impressive is the rally comes while the Russell 2000 is falling 0.30% marking some severe divergence between large and small caps. The beauty of last week‚Äôs mild retracement and today‚Äôs pole vault is that many Dow Jones stocks are flashing attractive entry points.

I‚Äôve scoured the entire Index and here are three of the best Dow Jones stocks to buy.

American Express (AXP)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

American Express (NYSE: AXP ) enters the new week having fallen five of the past six trading sessions. The retreat came after AXP stock notched a new record high at $111.77. Shorting a stock after a multi-day retracement from all-time highs has got to be one of the dumbest ideas I can think of. It‚Äôs the ultimate low probability play.

And that means doing the opposite is smart. Buying dips in an uptrend, particularly one that just surged in momentum like AXP, means you have the wind at your back. And with the stock already down a few percent from the highs, you‚Äôre getting a nice discount. Furthermore, we‚Äôre now much closer to support levels suggesting the risk is minimal if the setup doesn‚Äôt work.

Sell the Nov $105/$100 put spread for 97 cents.

Exxon Mobil (XOM)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

Oil prices are making a comeback, and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) shares are loving it. After carving out a low near $76 in mid-August, XOM stock rallied uninterrupted to $87. The ascent saw a groundswell in accumulation days signaling institutions were entering the fray.

Last week‚Äôs four-day pullback marks the first quality buying opportunity arising in the oil giant in two months. And I think it‚Äôs an opportunity worth pouncing on. If the slide persists many support levels loom close including old resistance near $84.50 and the rising 20-day moving average.

To build out a high probability of profit, consider selling the Nov $82.50/$77.50 put spread for 70 cents. If XOM stock sits above $82.50 at expiration, you‚Äôll capture the max reward of 70 cents. The initial cost is $4.30.

Boeing (BA)



Click to Enlarge Source: ThinkorSwim

Boeing (NYSE: BA ) rounds out today‚Äôs trio with a picture perfect breakout play. This morning‚Äôs 2.5% takeoff is officially carrying BA stock above major long-term resistance, completing an eight-month base. The expression, ‚Äúthe longer the base, the higher in space‚Äù comes to mind here. Given the dominance and duration of Boeing‚Äôs trading range this year, the importance of today‚Äôs breakout can‚Äôt be overstated.

It marks the beginning of the stock‚Äôs next leg higher and an easy entry point for spectators looking for an excuse to climb aboard finally.

Buy the Nov $380/$400 bull call spread for $8.
