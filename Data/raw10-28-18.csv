"Dow Stocks Apple Stock, Microsoft Stock, Visa, UnitedHealth Lead Amid Stock Market Correction","The stock market correction is causing severe damage to leading stocks, many of which are breaking support at key levels. While Dow Jones industrial average components Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V) and UnitedHealth (UNH) are below their 50-day lines, these Dow stocks have relative strength lines at or near new highs. This rare signal of strength vs. the S&P 500 index amid the widespread sell-off points to technical stability for Apple stock, Microsoft stock, Visa stock and UnitedHealth stock.

Top Dow Jones Industrial Average Stocks

Apple stock leads this group of top Dow Jones industrial average components with highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. Visa stock and UnitedHealth stock each earn a 98, while Microsoft stock has a 93. The Composite Rating combines key fundamental and technical metrics like earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.

4 Dow Stocks Stand Out In Market Correction

In addition to high Composite Ratings, these Dow stocks stand out with strong technical action despite the severe stock market correction. A clear indicator of technical strength is the relative strength line, which measures price performance vs. the S&P 500. When the line is at new high ground, that signals outperformance. And outperformance amid a stock market correction is especially bullish, since stocks tend to move in the same direction as the overall market.

Apple Stock

Apple stock has a relative strength line at new high ground, with shares up 12% from their last breakout several months ago. After pulling back from an early October all-time high of 233.47, Apple stock is struggling to hold near the 50-day line and is hitting resistance at that level. Apple fell 1.6% to 216.30 in Friday's stock market trading.

The first two pullbacks to the 50-day line after a breakout are seen as add-on buying opportunities. But the stock needs to successfully rebound from that level first. Also, investors should not be making new buys during the stock market correction.

Apple earnings are due Nov. 1. Fellow tech giants Amazon and Alphabet missed revenue expectations late Thursday, leading stocks lower Friday.

Microsoft Stock

And Microsoft, another tech giant, is showing relative strength despite a trip near its 200-day line Wednesday. An earnings-fueled rebound Thursday lifted shares some 5.8%, but Microsoft stock is still below its 50-day line. Shares fell 1.2% to 106.96 on Friday, less than the S&P 500's 1.7% retreat. So the RS line for Microsoft stock pushed to yet another high.

Microsoft earnings grew 36%, marking impressive acceleration from the 7% growth it saw in the prior quarter. Revenue growth has picked up for the last three quarters.

Visa Stock

Visa stock found support at its 200-day line on Thursday, rising 4.7%, after turning in a mixed quarterly earnings report late Wednesday. Its relative strength line is at a new high as well. Visa stock is hitting resistance around the 140 price level. Visa slid 2% to 137.74 on Friday.

UnitedHealth Stock

UnitedHealth stock has an RS line just below an all-time high, with shares hitting resistance at the 50-day line. Shares popped to a record 272.81 on Oct. 16 on UnitedHealth earnings. UnitedHealth stock is now trading 5.4% below that level amid the stock market correction.

The Medical-Managed Care group is ranked No. 12 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.

Stock Market Correction

With the stock market correction, investors should be extremely cautious about making any purchases. But a market correction is a good time to look for top stocks that are showing relative strength to add to watchlists. Once the market returns to an uptrend, those could be some of the first stocks to break out of bases and begin new runs.

Global stocks slide as investors fret over new tariffs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Early gains on Wall Street fizzled and sent global stocks lower on Monday after reports that the U.S. is planning an additional $257 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods if upcoming talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping fail to end a trade war between two of the world’s largest economies.

Additional tariffs on goods from China could be implemented as early as December, according to a Bloomberg report.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 245.39 points, or 0.99 percent, to 24,442.92, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 17.44 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,641.25 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 116.92 points, or 1.63 percent, to 7,050.29.7,050.29

The Dow had shot up more than 300 points shortly after the opening of trade, and at one point in afternoon trading was down more than 500 points.

“Obviously, this trade skirmish is metastasizing potentially into something worse than it already is,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.

Many stock indexes are already in official correction territory - meaning down 10 percent from recent highs - as investors fret about corporate earnings and global economic growth.

The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS lost early gains to slide nearly 0.7 percent. The index is down nearly 10 percent so far this month and has shed $6.7 trillion in market value since its January peak.

Shares in Europe closed broadly higher following Standard & Poor’s decision to leave Italy’s sovereign rating unchanged, prompting relief that there was no ratings downgrade.

Europe’s autos sector .SXAP jumped 4.9 percent, its strongest day since August 2015, after a report that China was considering halving the tax on car purchases to boost demand for autos, which has suffered from a trade war and slowing economic growth.

Asian stock trading was dampened by China’s blue-chip index, which tumbled more than 3.3 percent. Chinese data underscored worries of a cooling economy, as profit growth at industrial firms slowed for the fifth consecutive month in September due to ebbing sales of raw materials and manufactured goods.

Analysts have been downgrading estimates for European earnings at the fastest pace since February 2016, and weak results from internet companies Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) hurt U.S. stocks at the end of last week. Shares of Amazon.com lost more than 6 percent on Monday.

"Stock correction comes at bad time for Trump, GOP","A massive drop in stock markets this week is raising concerns that the market is headed for a large correction — and may also put a dent in the economic message in the closing weeks of the midterm campaign by President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump praises George H.W. Bush's humility and 'unflappable leadership' Former President George H.W. Bush dies at 94 Trump issues Alaska emergency declaration after earthquake MORE and Republicans.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average wiped out the entirety of its 2018 gains this week, while the S&P 500 dipped into correction territory, falling 10 percent below its September peak.

Economists warn that the falling stock market may not simply bounce back, as it has several times this year. The market, they say tends to be an early predictor of economic performance, and may presage worse economic news around the corner.

Statistics released by the government on Friday showed the economy growing at a healthy 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter. That was down, however, from 4.2 percent in the second quarter.

“The stocks market’s angst reflects the reasonable concern that the economy is going to slow moving forward,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The economy is growing strongly, but growth has peaked and that’s evident in today’s GDP [gross domestic product] number.”

Republicans had hoped the economy would help them this fall, and candidates across the country are continuing to try to use it to bolster their cases for reelection.

“Right after the administration was elected, the stock market went roaring straight up through the roof,” Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) said at a debate against Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger earlier this month.

The two are locked in a toss-up race for a district that has been in GOP hands for decades, underscoring the difficult environment for many Republican House candidates this fall.

Brat argued that handing the House majority back to Democrats would end the good economic times.

“It's no time to turn back to the failed Obama era and economy,” he said at the debate.

The falling markets could weaken that kind of argument going forward, in part because with the latest losses, markets under Trump have not risen at the pace of markets under Obama.

The Dow Jones rose 41 percent between Obama’s inauguration and the two-week period leading up to his first midterm. Since Trump’s inauguration it has risen 25 percent.

Since the downturn, Trump has been mum on the markets, a shift from his complaints on Twitter last week that the media was not paying enough attention to the stock market.

Third-quarter GDP growth was powered primarily by consumer spending and retail inventories, which typically reflect short-term confidence in the economy. Business investment and capital expansion fell over the past three months, warning signs that the Trump boom could be past its prime.

“It is an actual sugar rush. This is what it looks like when you have a sudden surge of income into households,” said Daniel Alpert, managing partner of investment firm Westwood Capital.

“The economy is overhyped.”

The GOP’s tax-cut law had an undeniable effect on the markets and the economy, goosing stocks up in 2017 as traders anticipated the tax cuts, and then helping to drive the 4.2 percent growth earlier this year.

The law has not been politically popular, however, judging from polls.

An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Friday found that the law made people more likely to vote for Democrats by a margin of 45 percent to 39 percent.

While scores of companies announced raises and staff expansion plans in the wake of the tax-cut law, there’s little sign of rising investment in training, equipment and facilities that boost economic productivity, Zandi said. Instead, he said, most of the tax-cut fiscal stimulus has come through rising consumer spending and other unsustainable short-term boons.

Zandi said that the benefits of lower corporate tax rates were likely cancelled out by rising interest rates spurred in part by the $1.5-trillion tax cut.

“If you borrow money to pay for the tax cuts, it raises interest rates and it raises the cost of capital,” Zandi said, calling the bill “a very costly way to go nowhere.”

Trump in recent weeks has criticized the Federal Reserve for interest hikes, calling it “loco” and “too aggressive.”

Democrats have put GOP calls for cutting back entitlements at the center of their economic messaging.

“Republicans blew a $2 trillion dollar hole in the federal deficit to fund a tax cut for the rich. To now suggest cutting earned middle-class programs like Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid as the only fiscally responsible solution to solve the debt problem is nothing short of gaslighting,” Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerThe Hill's 12:30 Report — Latest on Dem leadership votes | Trump threatens new auto tariffs | Senators briefed on Khashoggi Schumer welcomes his first grandchild No, it's not a gamble for Dems to back Beto for president MORE (D-N.Y.) said earlier this month.

The NPR poll found that 60 percent of respondents would rather roll back the tax cuts as a means of lowering the deficit than cut spending and entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

Despite those problems, Republicans are better positioned than Democrats were in 2010 when it comes to the economy. In that midterm, Democrats lost their House majority and more than 60 seats.

Unemployment dropped from 4.8 percent when Trump took office to 3.7 percent in September. Under Obama, who came into office as the Great Recession was still working its way through the economy, the rate rose from 7.8 percent to 9.5 percent in the equivalent time period before dropping to a low of 4.6 percent in late 2016.

In terms of growth, the economy is also doing relatively better.

Under Trump, quarterly growth has averaged 2.8. When Obama faced his first midterms, average growth had stalled out at 1.3 percent, dragged down by the last two quarters of negative growth from the recession.

Still, voters are generally more concerned with how they personally feel about the economy, rather than what newspaper headlines report about it.

Consumer sentiment in 2018 is higher than any year since 2000, according to the University of Michigan survey that tracks consumers' views on the economy. Household debt has also steadily increased throughout Trump’s term, a sign that consumers feel comfortable in their ability to pay down long-term expenses.

Even so, lagging wage growth and labor productivity could cut short the rush of spending and confidence if consumers are unable to keep up with rising interest rates and prices.

“You look at those numbers and you wonder what remains of household spending power. They’re not going to continue to go into debt,” Alpert said. “Maybe it has a little bit more room to grow, but it’s no healthy because all of this is not engendered by real wage growth.”"
