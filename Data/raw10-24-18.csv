Dow Jones Cut Loss Amid Bullish Move; 2 Blue Chips Soar,"The Dow Jones industrial average saw some of its components get tackled hard, NFL-style, yet other members flung higher on solid quarterly results. Despite an initial deep sell-off, stocks today are showing some rebounding power in late-afternoon trading.

X

Perhaps one factor for the rebound: Institutional investors bought back U.S. Treasuries. As these bond prices rise, the yield goes down. The benchmark 10-year note's yield at one point slipped to as low as 3.11%, down 9 basis points from Monday' close. It's still up from 3.09% at the start of October.

This may reflect a few things. One, fund managers still have confidence in the overall U.S. economy. (Econoday currently forecasts a 3.3% annualized rise in Q3 U.S. GDP, following 4.2% growth in Q2. The report is slated for early Friday.) Two, a slowdown in the rise in long-term interest rates suggests that inflation is not getting out of hand. And three, equities remain competitive with fixed income securities from a yield-based perspective. The 12-month-forward earnings yield for the S&P 500 remains much higher than the payout for 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds.

The Federal Reserve has already raised short-term interest rates by a quarter point three times in 2018, following three such rate hikes in 2017. Fed funds futures traders widely expect the U.S. central bank to boost the cost of overnight loans to big banks by another 25 basis points in December to a range of 2.25%-2.5%.

That would mark the highest level since January of 2008, when the fed funds rate was at 3%. Amid the subprime debt crisis brewing back then, the Fed then slashed the fed funds rate by three quarters of a point to 2.25% on March 18 that same year.

Verizon Leads The Dow Jones Industrials

Verizon Communications (VZ) and McDonald's (MCD) scored big gains to offset a hammering of Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM), two key manufacturing plays within the Dow Jones industrial average.

Both Caterpillar and 3M issued weak revenue outlooks amid a stronger U.S. dollar and uncertainty over the tariff spat between the U.S. and China, the world's No. 2 economy. McDonald's broke out of a long saucer with handle with a 172.10 correct buy point following a 19% jump in Q3 earnings to $2.10 a share.

The 30-stock Dow initially dropped more than 500 points amid continued angst over the future of global trade, rising interest rates in the U.S., and the midterm elections on Nov. 8.

However, at around 3 p.m. ET, the Dow industrials cut its huge losses to less than 0.3%. Ditto for the S&P 500, which fell nearly 0.3% after getting crushed early on. At 2747, the S&P 500 maintains a thin year-to-date gain of 2.8%.

The Nasdaq composite, down as much as 2% in the first hour of trade, cut its loss to less than 0.2%. At one point, the Nasdaq on Tuesday fell 10.7% below its all-time peak of 8133. Thus, the market has staged its second intermediate correction of more than 10% this year since the late-January sell-off.

The IBD current outlook for stocks remains unchanged and at ""market in correction"" until a follow-through occurs.

Verizon Results Communicate Growth

Verizon, a new addition to Leaderboard as a defensive stock with growth characteristics, rallied more than 3% to 57.11. Volume jumped more than 70% above average following a 24% rise in third-quarter earnings to $1.22 a share. That beat the consensus view by 3 cents.

Revenue edged up 3% to $32.6 billion. The New York City-based company's top line has now risen vs. year-ago levels for a fifth straight quarter.

The megacap telecom and broadband service provider posted a huge jump in aftertax margin for the quarter, up 290 basis points to 15.5%.

McDonald's And Its Golden Gains

McDonald's, also in the Dow industrials, rallied more than 6% and hit as high as 177.87, coming within a point of clearing the left-side high of saucer with handle.

The proper buy point is 172.10, 10 cents above a two-week handle's high. Trading near 177, this means McDonald's remains within the 5% correct buy zone.

The saucer-with-handle base, which tends to wear out investors rather than scare them out, began forming in late January. An 18% correction from the base's high to low is unusually shallow and reflects a general unwillingness among institutional investors to dump massive loads of shares.

On Tuesday before the market open, the hamburger and fries chain notched a 19% jump in third-quarter profit to $2.10 a share. Revenue fell 7% to $5.37 billion. Last month, the company announced that its classic burgers in its U.S. stores no longer feature any artificial preservatives, artificial flavors or added colors from manmade sources. Only the pickle contains an artificial preservative.

As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, McDonald's shows a decent but not great Composite Rating of 86, 12th best among companies in IBD's Retail-Restaurants industry group. The Composite score goes from 1 (terrible) to 99 (terrific). Keep in mind that McDonald's, with a $137 billion market cap, is not expected to grow as fast on the top and bottom lines as its smaller, newer peers.

Yet, strong industry group peers would be a boon for the global franchise.

The top three stocks in the restaurants group by Composite Rating: Dave & Buster's (PLAY) (Composite Rating of 96), long-standing IBD 50 name Wingstop (WING) (96) and Starbucks (SBUX) (95).

Energy Markets

In other financial markets, hopes for stable supplies from Saudi Arabia apparently triggered profit-taking in crude oil. U.S. near-term futures dived more than 4% to $66.56 a barrel.

Dow Jones Plunges As Stock Market Correction Deepens,"The major stock indexes sold off early Tuesday with broad losses in today's stock market action. The Dow Jones industrial average declined over 400 points after weak earnings results from Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM). Top growth stock Centene (CNC) faltered 8% after reporting its quarterly earnings results. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit the Stock Market Today.)

The Dow Jones industrials fell 1.9%, undercutting recent lows and once again giving up its 200-day moving average line. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 tumbled 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively.

Stock Market Earnings: MMM, Caterpillar Crash

Among companies reporting earnings, Dow Jones stocks 3M and Caterpillar crashed 7% and 9%, respectively, after disappointing quarterly earnings results. 3M missed its quarterly targets and lowered its profit outlook. Its stock hit a fresh 52-week low.

Caterpillar warned of higher costs, sending the stock down over 9%. Shares extended their losing streak to five trading sessions and over 30% off their 52-week high.

Fellow blue-chip stock McDonald's (MCD) bucked the stock market sell-off with a 5% advance after topping analyst estimates. Shares are just 2% off their 52-week high, as they hold above their 50-day line.

After the stock market close, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) will announce its quarterly results, as the stock fights for support at its 50-day line. Shares dropped 3% Tuesday after a German court sided with Boston Scientific (BSX) in a patent case. IBD 50 stock Boston Scientific fell almost 2% and is trying to find support near its 50-day line.

IBD 50 Stocks: Centene Buckles

Among the leading growth stocks, all components were trading in negative territory amid the stock market's sell-off.

IBD 50 stock Centene declined 9% after its Q3 earnings results early Tuesday. The leading Medicaid managed-care provider projected mixed guidance for the full year. Shares had been weathering the market correction, as indicated by its strong relative strength line. A flat base with a 148.34 buy point is no longer valid.

TransUnion (TRU) cratered over 5% after its earnings results before the stock market open. Shares dropped through their 200-day line. In early October, the stock triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule from a flat base's 76.09 buy point. The stock's breakout on Sept. 4 was with weak price action, a reason to be more cautious about the stock.

Selling spread to U.S. markets after bourses in Asia and Europe were roiled. London's FTSE 100 fell 1.2%, Germany's DAX 2.2% and the Paris CAC 40 1.7%. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index plunged 3.1%, the Shanghai composite 2.3% and the Nikkei 2.7%.

On Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 were down 0.3% and 0.4% but both had been down as much as 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively. The Russell 2000 fell 0.4%.

The Dow Jones industrial average cut its loss to 0.3% after components Caterpillar and 3M plunged on their earnings reports.

Caterpillar gapped down to a 7% loss, and 3M lost more than 5%. 3M alone accounted for nearly 100 of the Dow's 320-point drop. Post-earnings rallies for McDonald's (MCD), Verizon (VZ) and United Technologies (UTX) weren't enough to offset the losses on the Dow. McDonald's beat views and was added to IBD Leaderboard. Verizon was already on Leaderboard.

Volume was tracking sharply higher compared with the same time Monday. Declining stocks led advancers by roughly 2-to-1 across the board.

Indexes Undercut Lows

But even more worrisome was the fact that all three major indexes and the Russell 2000 undercut their Oct. 11 lows. That sets back the market's attempt to end its correction.

At today's low, the Nasdaq was down more than 10% from its prior high, which meets the traditional definition of a market correction. IBD already had determined the market was in a correction on Oct. 10. On that date, IBD downgraded its market outlook.

The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) cut its loss to 0.8%.

Oil equipment company Cactus (WHD) tumbled more than 8% below its 37.48 buy point, causing a key loss-cutting sell signal. Credit reporting firm TransUnion (TRU) gapped below its 200-day moving average after higher costs blemished third-quarter results.

The weakest sectors were industrial or cyclical: Energy, transportation and materials were off 1.7% to more than 2%. Crude prices tripped 4.7% to $66.12 a barrel, falling below the 200-day moving average.

How To Find The Next Stock Market Bottom? Use This Chart Technique"
"Market warning: 14 of 19 bearish signals triggered, Bank of America says","New York (CNN Business) Turbulence in the stock market can get old fast. But investors may need to get used to the bumpy ride.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch is warning clients that the roller coaster ride could last awhile -- perhaps through 2021.

""Expect a long bout of volatility,"" Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a report published on Sunday.

Bank of America keeps a running tally of ""signposts"" that signal looming bear market. The bad news is that 14 of these 19 indicators, or 74%, have been triggered. Two more were toppled earlier this month: the VIX volatility index ( VIX ) climbed above 20 and a growing number of Americans expect stocks to go up.

The recent market mayhem has been sparked by a variety of factors that all speak to an underlying theme: Investors are contemplating the eventual demise of the bull market. The bull run, which began in March 2009, is now the longest in American history.

The outbreak of tariffs threatens to slow the world's two largest economies and Wall Street has been forced to confront the threat posed by the US-China trade war The outbreak of tariffs threatens to slow the world's two largest economies and eat into record-high profit margins.

The recent spike in 10-year Treasury yields raised worries about higher borrowing costs . And it reminded Wall Street that the Federal Reserve has in the past raised interest rates faster than the economy can handle them.

""If US companies can't blow away the numbers when domestic GDP is growing at +3%, when exactly will they?"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote to clients.

Bear market warning lights flashing

Investors may be bearish, but a bear market may not be in the cards just yet.

Some bear market warning lights, mostly concerning market sentiment, have not yet been lit. For instance, Bank of America sees little evidence of the investor ""euphoria"" that overheats the market. Also, banks have not broadly tightened lending conditions.

The good news is that Bank of America said that previous market tops were preceded by a higher percentage of bear market signposts being triggered. Four of the past seven bull markets peaked with 100% of the indicators being triggered.

Bank of America found that it has taken the S&P 500 21 months on average to peak when a similar percentage of signposts were toppled.

""History says we've got 21 months,"" the analysts wrote.

Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, isn't willing to throw in the towel on the market either.

""I think there are still a few more quarters in this bull market yet,"" he said.

Are earnings fears overdone?

High volatility does not mean stocks have to go down.

Consider the 1993 to 1998 period when the VIX climbed from 15 to around 25. The S&P 500 generated annualized total returns (including dividends) of 22% over that span, Bank of America said.

One major concern that has emerged is that corporate profit growth will decelerate later this year and early next. Peak earnings growth could be triggered by a slower economy and the fading impact of the tax cuts.

However, Bank of America isn't worried because the S&P 500 has posted roughly average returns in the three and six months following peak profit growth.

Many Wall Street pros won't be willing to call the end of the bull market until a closely watched recession predictor goes negative. The yield curve -- the difference between long and short-term Treasury rates -- has inverted before every recession since in the past 60 years, according to the San Francisco Federal Reserve.

Although the yield curve has flattened in recent months, it has yet to go negative.

""That tells me we've got a ways to go,"" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

Even after the yield curve goes to zero, the stock market doesn't peak for more than a year, Slimmon said.

""This is just a correction within a bull market,"" he said."
U.S. stocks rattled as two industrial giants warn of trouble,"U.S. stocks shuddered on Tuesday as earnings reports from two industrial giants at the heart of the economy flashed warning signs.

On one of the busiest earnings days of the year, heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar told shareholders its business growth could slow and warned its dealers worldwide that it would raise prices because of the higher cost of steel in the wake of U.S. tariffs.

3M, a global conglomerate, caught many by surprise by reporting slowing sales growth and lowering its outlook for the year.

Investor unease is running high as the historic bull market — which has pumped out trillions of dollars in returns over a decade — has signaled vulnerability in recent days.

Markets are getting hit from many sides: fears that the Chinese economy is slowing; uncertainty over an upcoming U.S. election; rising interest rates in the United States; and worries that the long bull market is running out of gas.

[As stocks tumble, U.S. wonders: Is this economy as good as it gets?]



U.S. markets opened in a steep slide on one of the busiest earnings days of the year. (Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters)

By close of trading Tuesday, all three indexes had pared significant early losses. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was off 548 points at its low, closed the day down 126 points, or 0.5 percent, to land at 25,191.43.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 0.6 percent, its fourth decline in as many days. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has been whacked in recent weeks from the sell-off in the so-called FAANG shares — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet’s Google — dropped 0.4 percent.

All three had slipped to three-month lows in volatile morning trading.

The deepening tensions between the United States and Saudi Arabia after the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi also weigh heavily on Wall Street. Saudi Arabia’s ability to temper oil prices makes it a huge player in the global economy.

Closely followed Brent crude dropped more than 4 percent to $76 per barrel, a key threshold that signals a plentiful supply, at least for the near term.

“Politics and earnings,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of U.S. equity strategy at CFRA. “Both 3M and Caterpillar appear to be spinning their wheels and showing the true effects of global tensions.”

[This is almost a ‘too good to be true’ economy, Fed chair says]

Some analysts said the markets overreacted.

“This is the first time in several quarters Caterpillar hasn’t raised estimates,” analyst Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research said. “So it didn’t surprise as positively as in recent quarters. It was not a debacle.”

Another factor roiling the markets is the Federal Reserve’s commitment to gradually raise interest rates, which has drawn criticism from President Trump. Presidents historically prefer low interest rates because they help boost the economy and, in turn, help the popularity of whoever is in the Oval Office.

Rate increases have raised the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond to around 3.2 percent, its highest rate in years. The 10-year is closely followed because it is another indicator of the economy and the future of the stock market. Higher interest rates on the 10-year could steer investors to sell equities and turn to the less-risky Treasury note.

“Here is what is driving the markets the last 10 days,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “Is the Fed going to make a mistake? Is global growth going to slow down? What are earnings going to be in 2019? We don’t think global growth is going to slow. We don’t think the Fed is going to make a mistake. And we don’t think there is going to be an all-out trade war.”

[Winners and losers in the longest bull market ever]

Oil prices slid Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said it would increase production, which would keep world supply and demand for oil in balance. Oil prices are based on a careful choreography between producers and consumers, with politics, economic growth, weather, accidents, terrorism and a million other factors affecting oil prices.

West Texas Intermediate futures were also trading nearly 5 percent lower at $66 per barrel.

A Saudi surge would make up for any Iranian shortfall that accompanies the economic sanctions that are going into effect next month against that country. President Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement with Iran earlier this year, removing Iran supply from most oil markets.

“You look at everything going on — Saudi Arabia, the oil market, Brexit, Italy, the U.S. elections, the Fed raising rates — I could go on and on,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “The question isn’t why is the market reacting? The question is: Why isn’t it worse?”

McMillan said he sees the market dropping even more as part of a reality check on the economy and global tensions. The earnings season so far has been healthy, although some companies have reported a slowdown in revenue growth.

Analyst Matt Arnold of Edward Jones points to positive signs.

“Looking across companies, there are still healthy demand levels,” he said. “Costs are going up. Labor inflation is real. In periods of economic strength, that is what happens.”

But markets have seen several pullbacks, including an 11 percent decline in late 2015 and early 2016. Then the market dropped nearly 10 percent earlier this year.

“This is normal volatility. I would not be surprised if there’s more of a pullback,” McMillan said. “But as long as economic fundamentals remain solid, the market usually comes back.”"
"Dow ends down 125 points, but downbeat finish belies a significant turnaround for stocks","U.S. stocks on Tuesday finished in negative territory, albeit off the worst levels of the session, as worries about global economic growth and downbeat earnings outlooks from blue-chip companies sank equities following a rout in China's stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 125.98 points, or 0.5%, at 25,191.43, but had been down by as many as 548 points at its low of the session. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.82% lost 0.6% at 2,740.69, led by losses in energy stocks XLE, -0.18% and industrials. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% ended the day down 0.4% at 7,437.54 but enjoyed a brief stint in positive territory in a frightful and volatile day for U.S. stocks. Notably in corporate news, shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +4.18% closed off 7.6%, leading Dow decliners, after the industrial giant reported profits and revenue ahead of analysts expectations but offered guidance that was below consensus. Another Dow component, 3M Co.'s stock MMM, +1.64% finished off 4.4% after issuing downbeat 2018 guidance. 3M and Caterpillar combined to account for nearly half the Dow's loss at Tuesday's open at one point during the session. On big bright spot, shares of McDonald's Corp jumped 6.3% for its best day in about three years after its quarterly results on Tuesday. Markets headed lower out of the gate following the Shanghai Composite Index's SHCOMP, +0.81% 2.3% loss, giving back part of a two-day rally, and reigniting fears of a slowdown in the second-largest economy which rippled through markets. Still, some investors describe Tuesday's trade action as orderly and constructive despite the negative finish for stocks.

Dow Jones Falls; Will This Index Signal Future Bear Market?,"The Dow Jones industrial average, boosted by strength in Boeing (BA) stock following solid Q3 results, outperformed other key equity averages with a 1.1% decline in late-afternoon trading. Yet the bears still dominated the action in the stock market today.

News of a suspicious device sent to the New York office of news company CNN and key Democratic Party figures added more tension on Wall Street. Meanwhile, a popular gauge for small-cap stocks has now fallen as much as 14.9% below its all-time peak of 1100.58. This means another major round of selling by the S&P SmallCap 600 could send the index to a bear market-style correction of 20% or more.

The S&P 600 hit a near-term low of 938.07 intraday Tuesday during Wall Street's big morning swoon. It rebounded off that low to end the session off 0.8% and finished in the upper half of the day's range. Such action suggested that bargain hunting among equity desks on Wall Street intensified.

Heading Toward An Official Bear Market?

However, on Wednesday, the 600 undercut the prior session's low and slumped as much as 1.8%.

The Russell 2000, another popular gauge for small caps, sank almost 1.5%.

At 1495, the index is now down 2.6% year to date. The S&P 500, at 2701, holds a thin 1% advance since Jan. 1.

The Weakest And Strongest Industry Groups Today

Investors sold steel alloy, fiber-optic telecom gear, fabless semiconductor, basic chemical, lodging, semiconductor manufacturing and movie stocks hard. All of these industry groups dropped 3% or more. Defensive industries, including diversified utility, electric utility, nonalcoholic beverage, packaged food, confectionery food and soap, all rose well more than 1%.

At around 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite slid more than 2.6% and made new near-term lows as the FANG stocks dropped 1% to 4%. The S&P 500 slipped 1.7% and also traded close to session lows. Volume was running lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.

Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) fell 2.6% to 1,085 in below-average trade. The internet search giant has given back all the gains from a breakout at 1,178.26 in a nearly five-month double bottom and is back in the belly of that base. The stock also pierced through its long-term 200-day moving average near 1,135 on Oct. 10 and is trying to hold near the 1,100 round-number level.

On a weekly chart, the 40-week line, drawn in black, behaves similarly to the 200-day line on a daily chart.

Alphabet is slated to report Q3 results after the close Thursday. The Street expects a deceleration in earnings growth. Analysts see profit rising just 9% to $10.58 a share. In the prior five quarters, earnings per share advanced 28%, 27%, 32%, 28%, 28% and 19% vs. year ago levels.

The stock now trades almost 15% below a peak of 1,291.44. The Nasdaq composite, trading near 7324, is 10% below its all-time peak of 8133. The IBD current outlook for the stock market remains unchanged.

Bucking The Decline

On the upside, PagSeguro Digital (PAGS) bucked the decline with a minimal gain. The Brazilian facilitator of digital and point-of-sale transactions for small businesses is still in the early stages of forming the right side of a potential new base.

Wall Street sees PagSeguro growing its full-year profit 87% to 86 cents a share. The company was formerly in IBD Leaderboard.

According to IBD Stock Checkup, the midcap growth play gets a maximum Composite Rating of 99 and ranks second within the credit card and payment processing industry group, just behind Mastercard (MA).

Cosmetics, skin care and hair products retailing giant Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also rose mildly, representing a pocket of strength in the specialty retail space. The Leaderboard name is currently testing support at the 50-day moving average.

The former big winner during the 2009 to 2016 time frame recently broke out of a cup without handle at 260.60 and rose as much as 11% before gains began to fade.

Other Financial Markets

Crude oil rebounded amid news of a drop in weekly inventories in the U.S. WTI near-term futures rallied 1% to $67.01 a barrel. Oil continues to outperform both equities and other commodities with an 11% year-to-date advance.

Buying intensified in long-dated U.S. government bonds. The yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year note collapsed 5 basis points to 3.12%, edging closer to a month-to-date low of 3.05% set on Oct. 5.

After the close, growth stock leaders Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Visa (V) and ServiceNow (NOW) all report quarterly results. See the full earnings calendar with EPS estimates here.
