"Dow tumbles 340 points, on the verge of worst day in 4 months as velocity of bond-yield surge rattles stock market","The Dow Jones Industrial Average in Thursday action was on track for its worst day in more than three months as investors reacted to a recent surge in government bond yields. The Dow DJIA, -0.11% was down about 340 points, or 1.3%, at 26,493, at last check, retreating sharply, a day after posting its 15th record of 2018. A drop of that severity would mark the blue-chip benchmark's worst one-day decline since about May 29, according to FactSet data. The slump comes as the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.21% has punched up to seven-year highs at 3.21%, causing investors in stocks to reassess the comparative appeal of equities, considered risky assets, against so-called risk-free government debt. Moreover, rising rates translate in to higher borrowing costs for corporations. Only financials, including large banks XLF, -0.85% KBWB, -0.82% KBE, -0.39% were trading higher early Thursday among the S&P 500 index's SPX, -0.22% sectors. The technology-centric Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% meanwhile, was down 2.2% at 7,850, tumbling sharply, while the S&P 500 traded 1.3% lower at 2,888.

Also weighing on stocks, some analysts remain worried about political tensions in Europe and stagnant growth outside the U.S., leading investors to favor assets considered safer, such as the dollar.

In economic data released Thursday, a reading on weekly jobless claims came in better than expected with 207,000 Americans filing for benefits versus analysts' expectations for 230,000.

In commodities, U.S. crude oil futures were lower after hitting another multi-year high Wednesday.

On Wednesday, stocks powered higher, supported by a strong private hiring report and easing Italian debt fears.

Stock prices tumble as interest rate fears grip Wall Street,"NEW YORK – Just one day after the Dow Jones industrials average closed at a record high, global stocks nose-dived Thursday as interest rates in the U.S. continue to rise. The S&P 500 index suffered its biggest drop in months as internet and technology companies fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed again, to 3.19 percent, after hitting a seven-year high just a day ago.

Strong reports on job gains and the service industry have sent bond prices tumbling over the last two days as bond traders bet the U.S. economy will keep growing. Government bonds are stable investments that look most appealing when economic growth is shaky. But the big drop in bond prices is pushing interest rates sharply higher, a development that worries investors because it can eventually slow economic growth by making borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses.

After being hammered lower by more than 350 points earlier on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrials index ended the day down 201 points, or 0.75 percent, at 26,627. The S&P 5oo lost 24 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 2,902. The Nasdaq Composite took the day's hardest fall, tumbling 146 points, or 1.8 percent, ending at 7,880.

Google's parent company Alphabet fell nearly 3 percent, while Microsoft and Amazon lost around 2 percent each. Apple gave up 1.8 percent.

Thursday's drop ends three months of relative calm on the stock market as investors were heartened by the state of the U.S. economy and were growing less concerned about trade tensions between the U.S., China and other countries.

At 3.19 percent, the 10-year Treasury yield is at its highest level since May 2011, following encouraging signs on hiring by private companies and growth for services companies.

That data suggests the economy should keep growing at a solid pace. That translates to bigger profits for U.S. companies and continued increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which raises rates to keep inflation in check. But as interest rates rise, it becomes more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow money, and growth gradually slows.

Sameer Samana, strategist for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said after months of positive economic data, traders in the bond market are selling because they've decided yields are too low for them to get a good return on their investments.

""Economic data for months has been strengthening,"" he said. ""The bond market has completely ignored it until recently.""

Samana said investors aren't shying away from the stock market, because they're buying shares of companies that have been left out of the market's recent gains. Bank stocks are flat this year, while the S&P 500 index of industrial companies is up 4 percent and energy companies have risen about 7 percent. The S&P 500 itself is up 8 percent.

Tech stocks, which have led the market this year took sharp losses. But banks, which rallied Wednesday, kept rising. Higher yields mean they make bigger profits on mortgages and other types of loans. Bank of America added 1.4 percent to $30.43, and Wells Fargo rose 1.6 percent to $53.51.

Barnes & Noble climbed 21.8 percent to $6.65 after the bookseller said it will review offers from potential buyers, including one from founder and chairman Leonard Riggio, the company's biggest shareholder. Even after Thursday's gain, Barnes & Noble stock is slightly lower in 2018 and has lost almost two-thirds of its value since July 2015."
Dow falls the most in 2 months on fears of rising rates as 10-year yield hits highest since 2011,"Here's what four experts say to do next following Thursday's selloff 8:25 AM ET Fri, 5 Oct 2018 | 03:14

Stocks fell sharply on Thursday as interest rates hit new multiyear highs, dampening investor sentiment.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 200.91 points to 26,627.48 as Nike and Home Depot lagged. The 30-stock index dropped 356 points at its lows of the day and posted its worst decline since Aug. 10.

The S&P 500 declined 0.8 percent to 2,901.61, notching its worst day since June 25, with communications and tech sectors both sliding more than 1.5 percent. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.8 percent — its biggest daily drop since June 25 — to 7,879.51 as Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet all dropped more than 2 percent.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield reached its highest level since 2011, breaking above 3.2 percent.

""The level of the rates does not concern us,"" said Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors. ""That said, moving more than 10 basis points in two days is a different story. Pace matters and it bears watching."""
S&P 500 's 1.3% tumble puts the stock-market index on the brink of snapping an uncanny 71-session streak,"The S&P 500 index Thursday afternoon was on pace to log its worst day since late June, a decline that is notable because the broad-market index has gone an uncanny stretch without a 1% move in either direction. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% was off 1.2% at 2,890, at last check--a decline that would represent the first time that the equity gauge has experienced a 1% swing in the past 71 sessions, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That period of sideways trade, which still managed to keep the index within range of all-time highs, was the longest such stretch since the 95 consecutive sessions without a 1% move for the S&P 500 that occurred between Sept. 12, 2017 and Jan. 26. Thursday's downdraft for the benchmark comes as equity markets broadly were being yanked lower amid a surge in yields for U.S. government debt, which was forcing a reassessment of values for assets perceived as risky like stocks against so-called risk-free securities like bonds. The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.21% was at 3.19%, a day after seeing the sharpest one-session jump in more than a year. As a result, stocks have come under selling pressure, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% also tumbling sharply lower on the day.
