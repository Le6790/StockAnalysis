"Dow Jones Futures: Tesla, Microsoft, AMD Stocks Are Big Earnings Movers","Dow Jones futures signaled a rebound early Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, after Wednesday's stock market rout slammed the major indexes. After the close, Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Visa (V), Align Technology (ALGN) and O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) were notable stocks moving on earnings.

Tesla stock soared overnight, while Dow Jones components Visa and Microsoft advanced. But AMD stock, Align stock and O'Reilly stock crashed.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures rose 0.9% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures advanced 1.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures boomed 1.8%. Remember that action in Dow futures, Tesla stock, AMD stock and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular session. That's often been true in the current stock market correction, with big moves intraday and after hours.

In Wednesday's stock market trading, the Dow Jones tumbled 2.4%, falling below its 200-day line even with Dow giant Boeing (BA) rising on earnings. The Nasdaq composite plunged 4.4%, and the S&P 500 index lost 3.1%. All three indexes undercut Tuesday's intraday low. The latest stock market rout wiped out all the Dow Jones and S&P 500 gains for 2018.

Bottom line: It's a stock market correction.

Tesla Earnings

Tesla earnings came in at $2.90 a share, blowing out estimates for a 19-cent loss. Revenue soared to $6.8 billion as Tesla Model 3 output picked up.

Shares jumped 10% in premarket trading. Tesla stock closed down 1.9% to 288.50. Shares shot up nearly 13% Tuesday after short-seller Citron Research went long on Tesla.

Analysts likely will have questions about Model 3 production, operating costs, capital spending and more for Elon Musk in the post-earnings conference call beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET.

AMD Earnings

AMD earnings met adjusted per-share views, but sales came in light. Graphics chip sales were a weak spot.

Shares crashed 20% early Thursday. AMD stock fell 9.2% to 22.79 on Wednesday, hitting a two-month low amid several negative chip earnings reports. The Philly Sox index tumbled 6.6% Wednesday to a 13-month low.

AMD stock ran up sharply after its last earnings report on July 25. It hit a 12-year high of 34.14 on Sept. 13. A big part of the stock's rally stemmed from Intel (INTC), which cited delays in its next-generation chip. One reason for AMD stock's subsequent fall was Intel indicating that it was making progress on that front. Intel earnings are due Thursday night.

Microsoft Earnings

Microsoft earnings and revenue for the software giant's fiscal first quarter were well above estimates.

Shares rose 3.5% early Thursday. Microsoft stock closed down 5.35% to 102.32, falling further from its 50-day line and approaching its 200-day. But the Dow Jones tech giant's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is still near a record high.

Visa Earnings

Visa earnings topped views, but the card giant's revenue came in light.

Shares rose 3% in the premarket. Visa stock closed down 3.5% to 134.26, consolidating since its Oct. 1 peak of 151.56. The Dow Jones component is trading between its 50-day and 200-day averages.

Align Technology Earnings

Invisalign maker Align Technology earnings topped forecasts, but guidance came in light. Align stock tumbled 28% before the open. During Wednesday's session, Align stock slid 6.7% to 290.83, losing sight of the 200-day line and hitting a five-month low.

O'Reilly Auto Parts Earnings

O'Reilly Auto Parts earnings drove past forecasts, but sales missed and the auto parts retailer gave weak EPS guidance.

Shares skidded 4% late. O'Reilly stock already closed down 5.1% to 322.83, tumbling below its 50-day line and hitting a two-month low. Shares have been working on a 351.75 flat-base buy point.

Several other notable stocks reported late Wednesday, including ServiceNow (NOW), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and many more.

Dow surges 400 points as tech jump leads recovery from Wednesday's sell-off,"Stocks rally but still sharply lower for the week 12:58 PM ET Thu, 25 Oct 2018 | 03:09

Stocks jumped on Thursday as Wall Street recovered from a tumble in the previous session that sent two of the major indexes into the red for 2018.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 401.13 points to 24,984.55 — snapping a three-day losing streak — as Microsoft outperformed. The S&P 500 gained 1.9 percent to close at 2,705.57 as consumer discretionary and tech both rose more than 3 percent. The broad index also closed higher for the first time in seven sessions. Both are back into the green for 2018, but barely.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.95 percent to 7,318.34 as Amazon rallied 7.1 percent ahead of the release of its earnings report. A 3.4 percent jump in Facebook and a 3.7 percent gain in Netflix also lifted the Nasdaq.

""What happened yesterday was the market got way oversold,"" said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. ""Was a decline on earnings warranted? Yes, but not 10 percent.""

""The market is now correcting that a bit,"" Essaye said.

On Wednesday, the Dow plunged 608.01 points, erasing all of its gains for the year. The S&P 500 dropped 3.1 and also turned negative for the year. The Nasdaq fell 4.4 percent, entering correction territory.

These losses added to the indexes' steep decline for the month. Through Thursday's close, the Dow and S&P 500 were down 5.6 percent and 7.2 percent for October, respectively. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, had lost 9.1 percent. It's going to be more volatile on Friday after Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon sliding after releasing their quarterly results."
"Stock market: Should investors fear a correction, or 10 percent drop?","CLOSE Bear Market is a term that sends fear into Wall Street and investors. What does it mean? And how does it affect both Wall Street and Main Street? Adam Shell explains.

A screen above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shows the closing number of the Dow Jones industrial average, Wednesday, Oct. 10, 2018.

There's nothing more unnerving to stock investors than watching the market go down day after day.

Headlines about 600-point drops in the Dow Jones industrial average and pessimistic pundits predicting more declines have become more frequent in October. The big price declines and shrinking account balances are making investors queasy and prompting them to wonder if the money they have in the market and their 401(k) retirement plans are safe.

But the severity of any market drop on Wall Street needs to be put into the proper perspective – especially in a wild up-and-down environment like now when the Dow can fall 600 points in a single day, like it did Wednesday, only to rebound 400 points the next day, as it did Thursday.

Wall Street professionals use three measurements to define the intensity of a market drop from a recent high.

The three main descriptions of down markets are: a ""pullback,"" or drop of 5 percent to 9.99 percent; a ""correction,"" a decline of 10 percent to 19.99 percent; and the feared ""bear market,"" or 20-percent-plus drop.

""It's like turbulence on an airplane,"" says Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. ""(A pullback) is hardly noticeable, (a correction) is annoying and worrisome, and a (bear market) is truly frightening.""

After Wednesday's big selloff, the magnitude of the market's decline shifted closer to the ""worrisome"" category. Both indexes inched dangerously close to correction territory. Heading into Thursday's trading session, the S&P 500 was 9.4 percent below its Sept. 20 all-time closing high, and the Dow was down 8.4 percent from its Oct. 3 record.

But Thursday's big rebound rally, which pushed the Dow up 1.6 percent to 24,985 and the S&P 500 up 1.9 percent to 2706, enabled both indexes to climb back into positive territory for the year and dodge the dreaded 10 percent drop – at least for now.

More Money: Why states like S. Carolina, New Jersey and Iowa ban lottery ticket purchases with credit cards

Here's a primer on the three categories of stock market pain:

Pullback: first sign of trouble

Pullbacks, or dips of less than 10 percent, are normal periods of adjustment that get the attention of investors, many who had gotten too complacent. These drops, which often begin without warning, tend to be short-lived, however. And they normally aren't disruptive enough to change the market's longer-term rise.

The Dow, for example, has suffered 395 dips of 5 percent or more since 1900, according to Alan Skrainka, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth Management. That equates to roughly three pullbacks a year. The recent slide marks the second pullback of 2018.

And when it comes to losses, the average pullback for the S&P 500 since World War II has averaged 7 percent and lasted about a month, according to data from CFRA, a Wall Street research firm. Historically, it has taken about six weeks to recoup pullback losses.

At its low point Wednesday, the current downturn's 9.4 percent fall, therefore, is worse than average. . The sharp, swift decline has been sparked by fears that growth of the U.S. economy and corporate earnings will start to slow due to trade disputes and slowing growth in China, the world's second-largest economy.

Correction: 10 percent drop piques fear

Corrections are more serious market declines that kick in when the market suffers a 10 percent drop. Unlike pullbacks, however, corrections do more damage and last longer. In the 22 corrections in the post-war era, the S&P 500 suffered an average loss of 13.8 percent and dragged on for 148 days, or roughly five months, according to CFRA. After hitting a low, it takes the market about four months, on average, to get back to even.

A good example of a scary correction that did not morph into a bear market was the 10.2 percent decline that ended in early February. The S&P 500 recouped its losses in late August and went on to make a record high a month later.

Still, the greater severity of these losses tend to boost fears on Wall Street of a more serious coming decline, says Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at investment firm Baird. If the current pullback morphs into a full-blown correction, it would be the second of the year.

""The question is: Does it lead to a bear market?"" asks Bittles.

Corrections often intensify when fear levels rise on Wall Street and panicky investors sell to avoid even bigger losses, which exacerbates the downward pressure on prices. The market's situation often becomes more precarious when closely watched indexes like the S&P 500 sink below key levels that investors viewed as floors, or areas of support.

On Wednesday, for example, the S&P 500's downward spiral picked up steam after it was unable to stay above the 2710 level, its low from a selloff earlier this month. Similarly, the large company stock index's dive below its average price over the past 200 trading days also spooked investors, as it signals that the market's trend may be shifting from up to down.

What makes a correction ""trickier"" for investors to navigate is the fear that prices can fall a lot more ""before stabilizing,"" says Nick Sargen, chief economist and senior investment advisor for Fort Washington Investment Advisors. ""Selling also breeds more selling,"" he adds.

Not knowing if the double-digit percentage decline will get worse or prove to be a buying opportunity creates uncertainty for investors.

Bear Market: Wall Street's most feared decline

Bear markets, or drops of 20 percent or more, are feared by investors. The reason: They tend to erase a large chunk of the gains from the prior bull market, which results in huge losses for individual investors. The current bull run, which began in March 2009 and is the longest in history, registered a gain of 333 percent as of its recent record high on Sept. 20.

The average loss in bear markets dating to the Great Depression is nearly 40 percent, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. But the past two bear markets, including the one caused by the banking crisis that ended in March 2009 and the 2000-02 tech-stock meltdown, wiped out half of the market's value.

Stock prices in bears, on average, tend to slide for 21 months, or nearly two years, before hitting a bottom, data show.

If a bear drop of 20 percent occurs, it would slice a $100,000 investment in the S&P 500 at last month's high down to $80,000.

Brutal bear markets are normally caused by wildly overvalued markets like tech stocks in 2000, or shocks such as the OPEC oil embargo in the mid-1970s, or financial crises like the mortgage meltdown in 2008 that cause massive damage to the banking sector.

Bear markets also occur when the U.S. economy suffers a recession. Currently there are no signs of recession.

""A bear market is scary because the market decline is typically swift, and it's difficult to time when to get out,"" says Sargen.

To survive periods of market turbulence, Skrainka says it is imperative that investors have the right mix of investments that they can stick with in ""good times and bad."" In short, make sure your portfolio wasn't too risky for you to handle.

Other survival tips include maintaining a long-term perspective, making sure your portfolio is diversified and is filled with shares of quality companies that have a history of surviving difficult times.

""Most people buy when they feel good and the news is good; this is when prices are higher and future returns are lower,"" Skrainka says. ""Market declines can be the long-term investor's best friend because they offer the opportunity to buy good investments at a lower price.""

Dow surges 500 points as stock market attempts to claw back from Wednesday's plunge,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading at session highs Thursday afternoon, up nearly 500 points, a day after blue chips-- and the broader market--suffered one of the ugliest single-session routs of the year. Most recently, the Dow DJIA, +0.79% was trading up 495 points, or 2%, at 25,078, following a more than 600-point decline on Wednesday, which wiped out year-to-date gains for the Dow and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.82% Yesterday's slide also pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% to its worst single-session slide in about seven years, with the index falling into correction territory, defined as a drop of at least 10% from its Aug. 29 peak. Gains for the Dow were led by Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.64% and and Visa Inc. V, +1.88% which have both recently reported quarterly results. At current levels, the Dow's gains would represent their best since Oct. 16. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq was enjoying a 3.5% climb recovering a large chunk of its more than 4% tumble in the prior session.

Stock markets bounce back after US and Asia hit by renewed sell-off,"European markets are fighting back after a horror show for US and Asian stocks that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average back at levels not seen since the start of the year.

A bruising session on Wall Street on Wednesday saw technology stocks take a particular hammering - building on losses of recent weeks.

The Dow lost 2.4%, meaning it had erased all 2018's gains by the close.

The tech-dominated Nasdaq lost over 4% to enter a so-called 'correction' territory.

That is because it is now more than 10% below its August peak.

Shares in Asia followed the US lower, with Japan's Nikkei closing 3.7% down on Thursday.

The FTSE 100, which has little exposure to the technology sector, was 1% lower in early deals but European markets later turned positive - along with US futures - with traders citing some bargain hunting.

London's premier index was 0.2% higher on the day by lunchtime while the French CAC 40 and MIB in Italy led the way with gains of more than 1%.

The FTSE closed up 0.6% on the day, with the CAC 40 and MIB both closing up at 1.6% and 1.8% respectively.

Futures markets indicated the Dow would open about 1% higher in New York - a recovery, of sorts, on the previous session.

It went on to close up 1.6% on the day, with the Nasdaq up nearly 3%.

Bond prices rose, sapping yields, as traders sought safe-haven investments such as the yen and Swiss franc amid the sell-off.

Market experts blamed disappointing outlooks in tech company results for stoking jitters over world economic growth and future corporate profitability.

There are several factors behind those gloomier forecasts.

Top of the list is the US trade war with China.

Investors are also facing the expectation of higher US interest rates, which would boost borrowing costs for not only US firms and consumers but also many struggling emerging market economies with dollar-linked debt.

There is also Brexit, the suspected murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia and a big budget dispute between Italy and the EU in Brussels.

A plunge in oil prices, with Brent crude trading at $75 a barrel down from over $80 in recent weeks, has taken value from energy stocks too. It ended the day trading up 0.6% with Light crude up 0.2%.

Makoto Sengoku, market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute, said: ""This mess of bad factors has made it difficult for markets to seize a chance to turn up.""

Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, pondered whether the long-awaited bear market had begun.

He wrote: ""It looks like the poor US housing stats yesterday acted as (a) warning and investors took fright.

""We're in a period of pressure building to the downside as we get more down days than up and the breadth of the decline is important as is the volume.

""However whilst the recent spike in volatility may be seen as meaning we're past the peak, there may yet be a few breaths left in this old bull."""

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) jumped 7.6% on Thursday after surprising Wall Street with a profit in its third quarter.

The electric vehicle company posted earnings of $1.75 a share. Adjusted profit was $2.90 a share, a swing from a year-earlier adjusted loss of $2.92. Revenue for the quarter was $6.8 billion, beating Wall Street's expectations of $6.32 billion.

Twitter Inc. (TWTR) rose 15% after it posted stronger-than-expected third-earnings Thursday but said monthly active users fell a bit more than anticipated, suggesting moves by the micro-blogging website to limit hate speech and cull fake accounts were having an impact.

Dow stages 400-point comeback; S&P snaps six-day losing streak,"U.S. stock benchmarks staged a potent comeback Thursday, regaining much of the ground lost in a rout during the prior session that wiped out all the gains for the Dow and S&P 500 and put the Nasdaq into correction territory for the first time in two years.

How are major benchmarks faring?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.79% rose 399.95 points, or 1%, to 24,983, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.82% advanced 49.46 points, or 1.2%, to end at 2,705.57, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% gained 209.93 points, finishing at 7,318.34, a rise of 2.95%.

Stocks faded somewhat into the close, as the Dow was up 520 points, and the Nasdaq up 256 points, at their session highs. Nevertheless, the tech-focused Nasdaq notched its best single day performance since March 26.

On Wednesday, the Dow DJIA, +0.79% fell 606.11 points, or 2.4%, to 24,583.42, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.82% dropped 84.59 points, or 3.1%, to 2,656.10, its sixth straight losing session. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.79% shed 329.14 points, or 4.4%, to 7108.4, a performance that put the index more than 10% below its Aug. 29 all-time high, meeting the widely used definition of a market correction. The loss also marked the worst day for the Nasdaq since Aug. 18, 2011.

Thus far in October, the S&P has lost 7.15%, the Dow is down 5.57%, and the Nasdaq has shed 9.05% for the month.

Wednesday’s session had sent the Dow into losing territory for the year, but after Thursday’s comeback, the blue chip index is up 1.2% on the year. The S&P 500 is up 1.2% year-to-date, while the Nasdaq is up 6.01%.

What drove the market?

Market sentiment improved after Wednesday’s ugly losses, but investors expect continued volatility as they grapple anxieties over slowing global growth, tightening monetary policy, and fears that Corporate America has already reached peak earnings growth.

Strong quarterly earnings reports from Tesla, Microsoft, American Airlines and others helped to ease some of these concerns, reminding investors, that at least for now, the U.S. economy is strong, as stimulus from recent tax cuts continues to boost corporate profits.

Meanwhile, the European Central Bank reaffirmed its plan to end the asset-buying program at the heart of its quantitative-easing strategy in December provided data show inflation remains on track to eventually meet its target. The ECB left interest rates unchanged and repeated that they will remain at present levels “at least through the summer of 2019.”

Which stocks are in focus?

Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.64% shares posted their best performance since March, rising 5.8% after the company reported earnings and revenue well above expectations after the bell Wednesday.

American Airlines AAL, +4.53% shares rose 6.7%, after the company raised guidance for 2018.

Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +2.73% soared 9.1%, after the electric-car maker produced the largest quarterly profit in the company’s history.

Ford F, +0.43% had its best day in more than 9 years, as shares rose 9.9% after reporting better-than-expected earnings after Wednesday’s close.

Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -1.04% shares rose 5% Thursday, after the company announced it added 363,000 new internet customers in the third quarter, and surprisingly strong revenue growth at NBCUniversal.

Shares of Twitter Inc. TWTR, +0.48% soared 15.5%, after the company posted earnings and revenue beats for the third quarter, though a 9% decline in monthly active users was a sharper drop than analysts expected.

Altria Group Inc. MO, -1.98% shares rose 1.4%, after the company posted revenue and earnings beats, though it also said it would be taking certain e-vapor products off the market in an effort to address underage use.

Shares in Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -0.61% continued to slide Thursday, after the firm reported revenue and an outlook that missed expectations Wednesday, after the close. The stock fell 15.5% in trading Thursday.

Merck & Co. Inc. MRK, +1.84% posted an earnings miss Thursday, while reducing its full-year, 2018 outlook. Shares are down 0.8% Thursday.

Shares of ConocoPhillips COP, -1.03% rose 3.6% Thursday, after the company reported a third-quarter earnings beat.

What are analysts saying?

“From a valuation standpoint, the market is very affordable after Wednesday’s declines, and the economic fundamentals remain really solid.” Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, told MarketWatch. He warned, however, that investor sentiment is cautious, as markets wait for more information on the health of the global economy, trends in global trade policy, and the results of upcoming elections.

“This volatility is going to hang around until at least the midterms,” he said.

Mark Esposito, president of Esposito Securities, credited strong Microsoft earnings for helping to boost investor sentiment Thursday. “Microsoft is a real bellwether,” he said.

Tom Essaye, president of the Sevens Report wrote in a note to clients that so far, third-quarter earnings have been disappointment and that “peak earnings is a potential reality” that investors are now struggling with.

“But at this point the selling is overdone,” he wrote. “This selloff is now more about changes in market plumbing, similar to what we saw in August 2015 and January 2016, where selling itself becomes the main reason for the decline as algos, programs and funds pile on.”
