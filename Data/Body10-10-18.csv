the 800point drop of the dow jones industrial average on oct 10 may be a blip and so could the nearly 5 decline over five days in the sp 500 but they are also possibly leading indicators of the end of a historic bull market in which stockmarket indexes continue upward quarter after quarter markets are cyclical and experts only agree after the fact on what predicted an oncoming bearish period and even then often not and right now tech stocks—like the trilliondollar apple—have dominated a significant part of the rise in value of the market as a whole jitters about those companies have led to this shortterm fall too while drops were felt throughout the market rising interest rates from the fed and a tight employment market dont reassure investors either a bear market by many definitions requires a drop of at least 20 in the sp 500 from a bullmarket peak likewise a bear market starts counting at a 20 rise out of a deep trough many stockmarket observers pin the start of the current bull market the longest since world war ii at march 9 2009 as of october 10 its lasted 3503 days on august 22 it exceeded the previous record length which ran october 1990 to march 2000 historically almost all bear markets since world war ii have started with consistent and significant ongoing declines rather than simple volatility drops of 5 to 10 or even higher can occur during global financial and political uncertainty but theyre paired with similar rises bear markets start with consistent average drops so signs to watch for in the upcoming weeks and months arent volatility but an average tendency for the market to head downward across any fourtoeight week period in the 1973–74 stock market crash for instance the sp 500 peaked around 700 in december 1972 and then dropped a percentage point or two almost every month through october 1973 a 15 decline overall but then it plummeted crashing another 40 by september 1974 when it bottomed out the index didnt reach 700 again until 1987 bear markets since 1975 have had far lower percentage drops at their bottom even as markets have grown remarkably in inflationadjusted dollars the following bull upswings more quickly regain lost ground and then exceed prebear highs bull markets tend to end because of a defining event in 1956 the fed raised interest rates while international events like the suez crisis and the hungarian revolution caused investors to pull back in 1987 stocks dropped more than 20 percent on a single day—black monday oct 19—after a strong rally crashed into the persian gulf turmoil and trade deficits the previous bear market from october 2002 to october 2007 collapsed in the face of the global financial crisis precipitated by raising interest rates in the face of inflation that revealed the vast scale of subprime mortgages and other badly collateralized loans the good news bear markets are short compared to bull runs the most recent starting in 2007 lasted about 2 12 years though it took another four for the bull market to exceed highs reached in 2007

a look at why stocks plunged on wall street stocks plunged on wednesday the dow jones industrial average fell more than 800 points about 31 percent the nasdaq composite was down more than 4 percent at the close ailsa chang host stocks plunged on wall street today us stocks saw their biggest selloff in six months the dow fell 831 points which is a 3 percent decline here to talk about exactly what happened is nprs john ydstie hey john john ydstie byline hi ailsa chang so what made the market plummet today ydstie yeah it was a tough day and a number of things contributed lets start with interest rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks thats made the market nervous in fact this is the fifth straight day of losses for the sp 500 rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and theres concern in the market about just how high rates will go the federal reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop raising benchmark rates between 3 and 3 12 percent so it still has a way to go to get there chang so the way i understand it the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation right ydstie right chang are there fears of inflation right now ydstie well federal reserve chair jerome powell has said recently he doesnt see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a 50year low so theres concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressures chang but youre saying the economy remains strong so shouldnt that be good for the stock market ydstie the economy is strong in the us and most commentators are saying todays selloff is not the end of the bull market and stocks here but while the us economy remains strong europe has cooled a bit as have emerging markets and the imf gave a lessthanglowing assessment of the global economy this week less glowing than it did just a few months ago and of course there are concerns about global trade being disrupted by a trade war between the worlds two biggest economies the us and china and that hurts stocks chang are there any particular areas of the market that have been hurt by the selloff ydstie well virtually all sectors of the market sold off today wiping out all the stock gains since midsummer but the tech sector has been hit the hardest and its been one of the foundations of this bull market in fact the techheavy nasdaq index lost 4 percent of its value today and the sp 500 which also has a lot of tech lost 3 13 percent so its been a very tough day for tech chang a very tough day but is this just the beginning of a long downward trend for the market ydstie well most analysts i heard from today dont think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the dow down from around 500 points to 830 points down was due to machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that call for selling given the strength of the us economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profits in american businesses its difficult to believe the market will continue to melt down but we are at a point where investors are looking out over the horizon nine months to a year from now and wondering whether the fed will have raised rates so much that the economy gets pushed into recession were also getting to a point where bond yields are high enough that the interest rates theyre paying is starting to compete with stocks well see how foreign markets absorb this tomorrow and then the us market will have another crack at it and well see what happens chang i guess well see thats nprs john ydstie thanks john ydstie youre welcome copyright © 2018 npr all rights reserved visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at wwwnprorg for further information npr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm inc an npr contractor and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future accuracy and availability may vary the authoritative record of nprs programming is the audio record
