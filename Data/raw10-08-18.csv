Stocks close mostly lower as fears of rising interest rates linger,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced back from earlier losses to finish higher Monday, but the broader stock market closed lower as fears over rapidly rising rates continued to weigh on sentiment.

The bond market was closed in observance of Columbus Day.

How did major benchmarks fare?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% rose 39.73 points, or 0.2%, to 26,486.78. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% fell 1.14 points to 2,884.43 and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% shed 52.50 points, or 0.7%, to 7,735.95.

Defensive stocks drew bids, with consumer staples higher. One measure of consumer staples, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF XLP, +0.16% , rose 1.4%.

Monday’s action comes after the Nasdaq logged its worst weekly decline since March 23 and the S&P 500 logged its second straight weekly decline as long-dated Treasury rates surged to their highest since 2011. Bond prices fall as yields rise.

What drove the market?

A jump in government bond yields over the past several sessions has perhaps signaled a new phase in postcrisis markets that have enjoyed a protracted period of ultra-low yields.

Last week saw the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.21% rise 17 basis points, representing its sharpest weekly advance since February and taking it toward 3.23%, its highest level in about seven years.

Higher yields equate to steeper borrowing costs for corporations and investors alike, and have caused a reassessment of equity valuations, already deemed lofty by some measures. On top of that, richer rates of so-called risk-free bonds can compete against equities, which are perceived as comparatively riskier.

Climbing rates, however, have come against a solid backdrop for the domestic economy, with a number of economic indicators supporting the notion that the U.S. expansion continues apace.

As for quarterly results, companies in the S&P 500 are projected to post 10% earnings growth in 2019, according to FactSet, offering more evidence of economic health.

Abroad, investors were also watching developments in Europe, with the EU signaling in a letter Friday to Italy’s economic minister, Giovanni Tria, that Italy’s budget targets are a source of concern for the trading bloc, setting up a potential market-disrupting clash.

What were analysts saying?

The market was influenced by worries that U.S. economic growth may be jeopardized by higher interest rates, although buying in “oversold pockets” helped some stocks to recover, according to Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.

“Given that today is a federal holiday and the bond market is closed means that there’s less volume in today’s market. This lends itself to a market that can be skewed in either direction,” she said.

“The technical underpinnings of the equity markets argue on the side of caution. Despite new highs by the S&P 500 and Dow Industrials just a few days ago, the broad market continues to deteriorate,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, in a note. “Less than 50% of S&P 500 and Nasdaq stocks are trading above their 50-day moving averages. Although the popular averages remain in close proximity to record highs, the number of NYSE issues hitting new 52-week lows doubled from the previous week.”

David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said investors are seeing the jump in the 10-year yield as a sign that it’s time to exit stocks as rates are likely to rise further, particularly with the Federal Reserve expected to hike interest rates again in December.

Which stocks were in focus?

Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -1.93% dropped 4.4%, despite the electric-car maker Sunday night saying that it has achieved its goal of making the Model 3 sedan the safest car ever built.

Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.19% GOOGL, +0.26% fell 1% following a Wall Street Journal report that Google did not disclose a software glitch this past spring, leaving data from users of the Google+ social network exposed because of fear of reputation damage and regulatory inquiry.

ENSCO PLC’s stock ESV, +1.49% rose 3.7% after Rowan Cos. PLC RDC, -2.29% announced a merger valued at $12 billion. Shares of Rowan were up 1.9%.

Conagra Brands Inc. CAG, -0.49% shares gained 3.2% after UBS upgraded the stock to buy from neutral on the company’s long-term growth potential, which stems in large part from its $8.2 billion acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. Conagra’s price target was also raised to $40 from $38.

Kimberly-Clark Corp. KMB, +0.81% climbed 0.7%. Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to neutral after analysts determined that its buy recommendation “has not been successful.” The 12-month price target was lowered $1 to $119.

What were other markets doing?

China’s major indexes in Shanghai SHCOMP, +0.81% and Shenzhen 399106, +0.93% closed down by more than 3.5%, as traders returned to work after a weeklong holiday, and as China’s central bank loosened reserve requirements.

The Nasdaq is getting crushed. Here's why,"New York (CNN Business) The Nasdaq is taking a hit as investors pull away from risky tech stocks.

During trading hours Monday, the tech-heavy index fell by as much as 1.8%. The Dow and S&P 500 fell as low as 0.8% percent each.

The Nasdaq closed down 0.7%, while the Dow closed slightly up. The S&P closed about flat.

Each of the FAANG stocks — Facebook ( FB ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Apple ( AAPL ), Netflix ( NFLX ) and Google -( GOOG ) — declined.

Rising bond yields and interest rates are prompting investors to back away from tech, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.

""Whenever you see rates rise in a rapid fashion, you typically see tech take a hit,"" he said. ""As people start to get more concerned about the stock market in general, they pull back from more risky areas of the market.""

Zaccarelli explained that investors see tech stocks as a long-run asset. When borrowing costs go up, investors see their payoff move further away, so they turn to more reliable bets like utilities and consumer staples.

Bond yields spiked following the jobs report on Friday . The benchmark 10-Year Treasury hit 3.24% -- its highest level in more than seven years.

The 10-year yield influences borrowing costs, including mortgage, car loan and credit card rates.

Bond yields are rising because of America's strength . Intent on keeping inflation in check, the Federal Reserve is gradually raising its target interest rate, making borrowing more expensive.

That also increases the cost of paying back existing debt, which could slow spending — and the economy along with it. Last month, the Fed raised rates for the third time this year.

""You're now starting to see people price that in even to a greater extent today,"" Zaccarelli said of changes in the bond market.

Sam Stovall of CFRA Research said that ""investors are trying to lock in whatever profits they have.""

The Nasdaq is also vulnerable to the Fed and yields because it includes financial stocks, which could be impacted by higher interest rates, he said. That's because higher interest rates tend to slow growth, he said. When that happens, people and companies are less likely to borrow from banks.

That doesn't mean the Nasdaq will continue to fall.

Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, said that the dip represents a normalization.

Recently, there's been ""a tremendous amount of optimism about future growth baked into [the Nasdaq's] prices,"" he said. Now, we're ""getting back to something a little closer to normal.""

""I expect we're going to see market confidence recover,"" he said."

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25.32% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through November 5, 2018. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

"Dow stages powerful reversal to end higher, but tech stocks sink a 3rd session in a row","The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% on Monday managed a potent intraday reversal to eke out a modest gain, but technology shares declined for a third straight session as a period of rising rates knocked equity benchmarks around. The bond market was closed in observance of Columbus Day. The Dow DJIA, -0.11% ended by up about 40 points, or 0.2%, at 26,487, but the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22% finished the session less than 0.1% lower at 2,884, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25% closed down 0.7% at 7,736. marking its third down day in succession for the tech and internet-related benchmark. Monday's action was a continuation of Friday's stumbles which were sparked, at least in part, by a surge of the yield of the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.21% on Friday to 3.23%--the highest level since 2011. Bond prices fall as yields rise. Rising yields mean higher borrowing costs for corporations and climbing rates can also make stocks comparatively less attractive than Treasurys, which are perceived as risk-free assets. Rising rates have been a particular headwind to stocks that had helped partly drive stocks to new records, including Netflix Inc. NFLX, +2.16% Facebook Inc. FB, +1.40% Google-parent Alphabet GOOG, +0.19% GOOGL, +0.26% Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.77% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.25% but have since been under pressure.
