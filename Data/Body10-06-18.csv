while firing an underperforming chief executive officer can help a company sometimes the bad news is that more bad news is coming this weeks firing of john flannery as ceo of general electric co nyse ge should put investors on alert that a breakup of ge is now more likely than it was even back when flannery was conducting his own review of the company this potential breakup became more likely after the news broke that ge was booted out of the dow jones industrial average but a new ceo only will create more of a belief that a breakup of ge is more likely and when investors consider who is taking over at ge they probably will consider the breakup case even further while there is a case that ge is better off as a whole entity and that separating ges various debt instruments from unit to unit would be difficult there is the very serious notion that nothing else may work what if wall street continues to treat the combined general electric as a company named general eclectic flannery bombed in convincing wall street that his strategy was going to turn ge around its new ceo is larry culp who is only 55 years old culp previously served as chief executive officer and president of danaher from 2000 to 2014 leading a transformation from an industrial manufacturer into a leading science and technology company what does this tell you about ge as being an industrial manufacturing outfit if you look beyond the quotes in ges press release the company noted that culp effectively executed a disciplined capital allocation approach and that he helped with a series of strategic acquisitions and dispositions and targeted investing in highimpact organic growth and margin expansion the ge announcement also noted that under culp danaher delivered strong free cash flow to drive longterm shareholder value and that danahers market capitalization and revenues grew fivefold under his 14year tenure now break out the actual quote from culp on assuming the ceo role ge remains a fundamentally strong company with great businesses and tremendous talent it is a privilege to be asked to lead this iconic company we will be working very hard in the coming weeks to drive superior execution and we will move with urgency we remain committed to strengthening the balance sheet including deleveraging tom and i will work with our board colleagues on opportunities for continued board renewal we have a lot of work ahead of us to unlock the value of ge also noted in last weeks news break was the turbines from the power business ge said on monday that it will take a noncash goodwill impairment charge related to the ge power business and that the charge is likely to constitute substantially all the 23 billion or so tied to the unit also worth noting was the statement that the impairment charge is not yet finalized and remains subject to review which means more charges may be possible and less for that matter still ge cited weaker performance in the ge power business as the main reason for lowering its previously indicated guidance for free cash flow and in earnings per share for 2018 now consider how ceo culp has an incentive to boost ges share price he will receive payouts if ges stock rises at least 50 and can stay there for 30 consecutive trading days the news of his hire took it up about 10 alone several analysts have issued views in the wake of ges big ceo change rbc capital markets raised its rating to outperform from sector perform and raised its price target to 15 from 13 after the ceo change moodys said that it was reviewing ge credit for a possible downgrade and that downgrade was more than one notch standard poors downgraded ge and it is now only three notches above junk bond ” status these both addressed weakness in power but also both include at least inklings about ges future structure changing as the company tries to deleverage its balance sheet merrill lynch has only a neutral rating but also has a 14 price objective the firm is projecting a significant dividend cut as one of the first orders of business as the company has to shore up its balance sheet before lots of debt comes due in 2019 the merrill lynch report said we expect additional management and operational changes within ges segments particularly power… accelerating portfolio moves announced in july could be another avenue to shore up the balance sheet such as accelerating monetization of 625 bhge ownership morningstar has a 1610 fair value estimate on ge but it thinks that the culp strategy may be quite similar to flannerys strategy that report said we think culp is the right person for ceo and should help ge realize the value of its assets given an outsiders operating pedigree we expect differences in execution under culp even as we suspect hell largely stick with ges current roadmap–focusing on aviation power and renewable energy — as laid out by flannery and approved by the current board its hard to imagine that the future ge will look nothing like the ge that prior generations knew that said the world keeps on turning — and ge hasnt been keeping up with it ge shares closed up 42 at 1318 on friday thats up nearly 17 from the 1129 the prior friday before flannery was fired and culp was named ceo its 52week trading range is now 1121 to 2454

the mere mention of october is enough to frighten some investors while others wonder whats the big deal ” sure five of the stock markets worst 10 days happened in october but overall its a pretty average month for the market instead the history lessons to turn to this month are about infrequent events such as the us midterm elections or when stocks appear mispriced heres what investors will be watching about those elections investors are already betting on a split congress with democrats possibly taking over the house if democrats were to gain control of both the house and senate that might rattle the market said craig hodges chief executive at hodges capital management which oversees six mutual funds since 1946 the sp 500 has never declined in the 12 months following midterm elections hodges said citing research he has conducted whats more the sp 500 has seen an average fourthquarter return of 79 percent during midterm election years he adds but dont be surprised if the stock market hits a temporary rough patch before then we certainly could see some volatility going into the elections ” said matthew etter owner of signet financial management a registered investment adviser that would be a departure from a relatively calm market recently what to do while midterm elections could boost the market theres another important reason for optimism economic growth is solid for hodges that further supports being fully invested by november not keeping cash on the sidelines any dip i would use as a real buying opportunity ” he said hunt for value remember back in january and february when the market fell 10 percent in a matter of days the sp 500 fully recouped those losses by august and the dow jones industrial average did so in september what has been good news for your portfolio has some investors feeling squeamish about investing when stock prices are high but perspective matters hodges says and some stocks look downright cheap there are more mispriced stocks in the market than ive ever seen before ” he says it all boils down to the two fundamental styles of investing value focusing on stocks that are undervalued by the market vs growth seeking stocks that deliver betterthanaverage returns growth stocks have largely been this years highfliers ” while value stocks are lagging behind the performance of the broader indexes the performance differential for these different styles has become overstretched ” which creates opportunity for longterm investors etter said among the largest 1000 us stocks the index tracking growth stocks has soared nearly 16 percent this year while the index tracking value stocks is up just 2 percent similarly smallcap growth stocks have jumped more than 15 percent yeartodate value stocks have risen 57 percent while it may be tempting to continue investing in the best performers etter said history has shown us that we dont spend our entire life in a growth cycle ” what to do investors looking for a tactical approach can prepare for this type of market change now by buying value stocks hodges sees fertile opportunities for stockpicking within smallcaps and in industries such as industrials energy homebuilding and transportation etter says exchangetraded funds offer an accessible way to attack this strategy stock market forecast much has been made of the long shadow of the 2008 financial crisis in light of its 10year anniversary various surveys have shown that investors remain spooked and my what noninvestors have missed the sp 500 has more than doubled in the past 10 years thats why the stock market remains attractive for buyandhold investors as for the outlook ahead professionals on wall street forecast the sp 500 will end the year slightly higher than its current level — up 17 percent to be precise according to the average forecast of strategists surveyed by cnbc still theres neardaily talk of an imminent market crash among other prognosticators yes you can prepare for a market crash but when one strikes your emotions could get the better of you thats why many investors prefer to remove emotion altogether by working with a financial adviser — either of the human or roboadviser variety if you are navigating investing on your own there are simple steps to take • dont try to time the market sell when you think the market is at its peak • add money to your investments regularly this strategy known as dollarcost averaging smoothens out your purchase price over time • diversify your holdings across a variety of assets to reduce your overall risk • accept that volatility is inherent to investing but not something to stress about for longterm investors annalouise jackson is a writer at nerdwallet email ajacksonnerdwalletcom twitter aljax7 
investors are getting nervous warren buffett — arguably the most successful investor of all time — is hoarding cash because he cant find anything trading at a reasonable price to invest in markets quietly correcting meanwhile mark minervini — one of the most successful stock traders of modern times – owned up recently to being mostly in cash too on 2 october he tweeted his observation that americas dow jones industrial average dow is catching the headlines by moving higher while more than half the stocks in the nasdaq composite index are trading below their 200day moving averages the significance of that is that there are only 30 stocks in the dow and around 3000 in the nasdaq generally traders consider a stock price trading below its 200day moving average as a bearish sign he also thinks the russell 2000 index is showing weakness and thats home to around 2000 of americas companies as the name suggests his view is that the broader market is quietly correcting ” and he thinks trading conditions are risky ” meanwhile many have been waiting for a significant market correction across the pond for years if you look at charts for the dow nasdaq and russell 2000 youll see that theyve all shot up rocketlike for many years without any sign of a meaningful correction and you dont have to look very hard to find arguments that many american firms are overvalued perhaps the quiet correction could become louder why it matters to us does it all matter to us here in blighty after all the median forecast pricetoearnings ratio for all shares with estimates in the uk is running at about 13 and the median forecast dividend yield of all uk dividend payers is around 35 those figures are a long way from the eyepopping valuations were seeing with many firms stateside well i think it does matter the problem for us in britain is twofold firstly we have a much larger proportion of cyclical businesses in our main indices such as miners oil companies banks and the like which attract much lower valuations because of their inherent cyclical risk this means that valuation averages can deliver a false sense of safety secondly there is a long history of our stock market following the big movements in america– especially the deep plunges weve also got our own problems to worry about nobody really knows how the act of actually leaving the european union and its aftermath will affect the economy company profits and share prices that could be a catalyst for a selloff or maybe even a relief rally once weve actually done it and the uncertainty has passed because stock markets hate uncertainty more than anything else yet if we do see a big correction in the markets you can bet your bottom dollar that warren buffett will start seeing value again and mark minervini will pin down some decent trading setups and both will be filling their boots with stocks in the meantime i reckon a good strategy could be to keep dripping money into the stock market whatever happens next and let poundcost averaging smooth your longterm compounded returns theres no need to divert your funds to baked beans and shotguns after all are you prepared for brexit following brexit fear and indecision could hurt share prices in the coming months thats why the analysts at the motley fool have written a free guide called brexit your 5step investors survival guide to get your copy of the guide click here now kevin godbold has no position in any of the shares mentioned the motley fool uk has no position in any of the shares mentioned views expressed on the companies mentioned in this article are those of the writer and therefore may differ from the official recommendations we make in our subscription services such as share advisor hidden winners and pro here at the motley fool we believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors
