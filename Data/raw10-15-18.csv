Madeleines and Sunshine

Stocks are moving in opposite directions Monday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3% shortly before noon on the East Coast, while the S&P 500 was up 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%.

With stocks divided at the start of the week, given relatively few fresh earnings reports and tech, the longtime market leader, in the red again, the big question on investors’ minds is obviously whether or not we’re in for another big dive—one that could be a bull killer.

You don’t have to be the preeminent Proust scholar in the U.S. to have an idea of what’s happening here: The bull market is nine years old, and while the cage has been rattled a few times, we’ve been largely spared prolonged, painful drops. When you’re #winning, it’s easy to forget how bad the bad times can be, but big downward moves like we saw last week trigger memories of what it’s like when the stock market doesn’t go relentlessly higher. And those recollections aren’t pleasant.

Still, it’s important to keep everything in context, says Richard Bernstein Advisors’ Dan Suzuki. On average, pullbacks of more than 5% have occurred three times or more per year, going back to 1928, but less than 20% of them lead to 15% corrections. Only t 10% ushered in full-blown bear markets.

“We believe that in order for this pullback to turn into a bear market, we would need to see signs of a profits recession, significant tightening up of liquidity and/or unrealistically bullish investor expectations,” he writes. “We see none of these signals today. While overseas profit fundamentals have slowed, we think investors may still be underestimating the nominal profit growth potential here in the US.”

Perhaps part of the problem is that in a masochistic sort of way, investors have been anticipating the demise of this bull market since it started. As Yardeni Research’s Ed Yardeni writes, this is “the most hated bull market in history.” Even with stocks’ stellar success in the past nine years, the scars of 2008 are deep, and thus, “the next downturn has been the most widely anticipated recession of all time. It’s been widely feared to be lurking just around the corner since the last recession.”

By his count, we’ve had 62 “panic attacks” since the bull market began, including last week’s selloff, and all the past 61 have been followed by relief rallies. Still, it may be disconcerting that unlike with the Brexit vote or the 2015 yuan devaluation, there’s no one, blindingly obvious cause for the recent rout. That makes the decline harder to explain away.

Ned Davis Research’s Ned Davis isn’t even going to try, writing that he doesn’t know if the Dow’s Oct. 3 close marked a peak or not. What he does know is that, unsurprisingly, after bull-market peaks, investors often turn more defensive.That should make things interesting, he writes, as his research shows that utilities and consumer staples are currently big underweights.

For what it’s worth, both utilities and staples are outperforming the broader market today. Stay tuned.

Every Country's Stock Market Loses From Trade Tensions,"By Jodie Gunzberg

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently released its World Economic Outlook, October 2018, with estimated global trade tension scenario impacts on GDP. Overall, the IMF states that recent tariffs will hurt GDP and that additional tariffs will weaken it further. In the long term, according to the IMF's scenario analysis, the U.S. GDP will be 0.9% lower and China's GDP will be 0.6% lower as a result of the trade tensions. However, in 2019, the disruption caused by an escalation of trade restrictions could be particularly large with GDP losses of more than 0.9% in the U.S. and over 1.6% in China.

Source: Source: IMF staff estimates. World Economic Outlook, October 2018: Challenges to Steady Growth; October 8, 2018.

Based on the IMF estimates and the historical sensitivity of stock markets to GDP growth, if the trade tensions escalate, some countries may be impacted more than others. This can be measured globally by starting with the total U.S. dollar market capitalization of the S&P Global BMI (Broad Market Index) by country. The United States is the largest in the world, representing 53.5% of the total market cap worth $27.8 trillion as of October 11, 2018. South Korea is the smallest country of the top ten by size and has an index weight of 1.7% that includes about $902 billion. In total, the top ten biggest countries by market value include 86% of the world's $52 trillion total market value.

Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices Data as of October 11, 2018.

Next, the historical sensitivities of each country's stock market-to-GDP growth is measured. For example, for every 1% of U.S. GDP growth, the U.S. stock market value increased 3.79% on average (using year-over-year data from 1993-2017.) South Korea is most sensitive with a 9.35% stock market value increase on average per 1% of U.S. GDP growth, while Japan is least sensitive, gaining just over 2% on average per 1% of U.S. GDP growth. The greater the percentage of its output a country exports to the U.S., the bigger the influence U.S. GDP growth has on that country's stock market, since the U.S. growth is so heavily driven by consumer spending. Overall, the stock market sensitivity is far greater to U.S. GDP growth than to China's.

Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Data is year-over-year from 1993-2017 for all countries, except is from 1998 for Korea and China, as well as the composites.

After measuring the stock market sensitivity of the ten biggest countries in the S&P Global BMI to each U.S. and China GDP growth, the decreased GDP as estimated by the IMF can be applied to understand how stock market values may be reduced. In total, if the U.S. and China GDP were to drop in 2019 by 0.9% and 1.6%, respectively, the global stock market value may lose $2.17 trillion, or 4.9% of its value from the top ten countries. A total market value loss of about $1.49 trillion and $687 billion can be attributed to the GDP reduction in the U.S. and China, respectively. While the total dollar market value loss in the U.S. would be biggest with a magnitude of $1.39 trillion, the greatest percentage declines in market value impact South Korea and China with 12.4% and 8.2% losses respectively.

"S&P 500 Market Outlook: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly","Timing the stock market is no easy task – especially when panics hit the street. Buying stocks during vicious corrections is not for the faint-hearted, especially on days when the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1000 points.

During these times, “When will the stock market stop tanking?” is the prevailing question asked by investors looking to bargain shop.

The real question is “when is the right time to pull the trigger?” And many thought that the first dip two weeks ago was the time to get in.

However, the S&P 500 futures chart below with Buy and Sell signals generated by the Market Inflections algorithm tells a different story.

S&P 500 Futures Chart

Sign up for our FREE newsletter and receive our best trading ideas and research Leave this field empty if you're human:

In late June 2018, these algorithms generated a series of what we call Minor Buy signals on the daily chart of the S&P 500 Futures Contract. And a few weeks later in early July, a Compression signal triggered suggesting a new trend was about to begin. Over the next few months, the S&P climbed more than 200 points.

In late August 2018, a Sell signal was generated. And now after a 250 point drop, a stock market Buy signal appeared last week which is statistically significant through early December 2018. Similar Buy signals were generated on the daily charts of the Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000. As a result, we expect the recent downtrend to come to an end and sideways or higher price action to prevail over the next six to eight weeks.

Unfortunately, this is not the whole story ( get the full report here for free ). While the Buy signals on the daily charts of the major market indexes suggest that stocks should trade higher in the weeks to come, our algorithms have generated much larger Sell signals on both the weekly and monthly charts of the S&P 500 Futures Contract. The implication here is that while stocks are likely to recover in the short-term, any rally that unfolds will likely be temporary.

Thanks for reading! And be careful out there — volatility and average true ranges are likely to remain elevated. What we saw last week might just be a “pre-shock” of much greater market instability in the months and years to come.

This stock-market pullback probably has further to go: analysts,"The new mantra for investors this week may be good things come to those who wait.

Wall Street pundits on Monday continued to urge caution, predicting that the stock market turbulence is far from over. Yet many of them ended their commentary on an optimistic note, suggesting that the bullish backdrop for stocks remains intact.

Stephen Suttmeier, a technical research analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said there are plenty of oversold stocks and bearish sentiment is on the rise but the market has not quite deteriorated to a point where the negative trend turns into a contrarian indicator to buy.

“More time and downside tests may be needed for a firm market low,” said Suttmeier in a note to clients.

One technical indicator the analyst is watching is the CBOE 3-month Volatility Index/CBOE Volatility Index VIX, -3.83% ratio which closed at 0.863 on Oct. 11, the “most fearful oversold” since it dipped to 0.758 on Feb. 5.

“Spikes below 1.0 on the VXV/VIX have suggested tactical capitulation and have coincided with important lows on the S&P 500, but these lows sometimes get retested,” he said.

About 46% of S&P 500 stocks are above their 200-day moving averages, the lowest since early 2016, while 12% of stocks were hitting 52-week lows as of last week.

“This deterioration is seen across all the major U.S. equity averages and suggests a weakening or later stage bull trend from early 2016,” he said.

For now, the S&P 500 is trading above its 12-month moving average while its monthly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) — a momentum indicator that illustrates the relationship between two moving averages of prices, remains a buy signal. But if the S&P 500 12-month moving average falls below 2,747 and the monthly MACD switches to a sell signal, the risk for a bear market will rise, according to Suttmeier.

Another metric to keep an eye on is the high-yield option adjusted spread—the premium that investors demand in return for owning riskier debt over investment grade.

“The big level to watch on the high yield OAS is 3.68-3.72 (2018 peaks). A break above this level would point to increasing credit market stress and likely confirm a failed breakout in the S&P 500 ahead of a bigger equity market pullback,” the analyst said.

The high-yield OAS traded at 3.44 last week.

Key support ranges to monitor for the S&P 500, levels where investors feel comfortable about buying back into the market, are 2,729 to 2,710 and then 2,692 to 2,676.

But as bad as things look, there are reasons to be upbeat.

“Many people focus on ‘sell in May and go away’ but the better and much less well known pattern for the market is ‘buy in October and stay’,” said Suttmeier, who pointed out that November to April is a good time for stocks.

Going back to 1928, this six-month period has been up 71% of the time for an average return of 5.07%. This time, it could be even more bullish given the traditional boost from a midterm election year, he added.

Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Canaccord Genuity, likewise predicted that it could take some time for the pullback to resolve itself.

“We find it unlikely there will be a V bottom given the sharpness and breadth of the correction,” he wrote in a Monday note.

In fact, he went as far as to hint that the market’s rally to 3,200, which he had predicted by the end of the year, could be delayed into 2019 depending on how long it takes for the market to bottom. However, he stopped short of revising his outlook and reiterated his view that the current period of weakness is likely to be temporary.

“It is essential to remember that while any number of fundamental excuses could be used, this correction was born out of 1) excessive optimism; 2) an extreme intermediate-term overbought condition; and 3) historically low volatility – rather than a significant enough fundamental change that would suggest a shutdown of credit, and ultimately negative EPS,” he said.

Here is Dwyer’s checklist of tactical indicators to watch:

Meanwhile, David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, reminded investors that 5% drawdowns are fairly common.

“Since 1928, the index has typically suffered a 5% pullback once every 71 trading days. 69 trading days elapsed between 5% drawdowns prior to Thursday,” he said.

The good news, though, is that Goldman strategists do not see much significant upside to bond yields and expect the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% to close out the year at 3.1% compared with 3.161% currently.

Kostin stuck with his year-end S&P 500 target of 2,850, noting that the probability of a recession in the next three years is roughly 37%.

“The year to date surge in EPS combined with a modest climb in S&P 500 has reduced forward P/E multiples by 14% to 15.7 times, reducing valuation risk for equity investors,” he said.

One indicator that Kostin finds encouraging is the strong return on equity, a popular gauge for corporate profitability, which rose to 17.5% in the second quarter, among the highest in the past 40 years. Excluding financials, ROE hit a record of 20.7%.

Still, the strategist expects companies to feel some margin pressure given higher interest rates and recommended investors to focus on corporations with strong balance sheets such as TripAdvisor Inc. TRIP, +0.82% Under Armour Inc. UA, +2.67% Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, -1.94% Marathon Oil Corp. MRO, +0.85% and Amgen Inc. AMGN, +2.91%

Stocks resumed their march south following a reprieve on Friday with the S&P 500 SPX, +0.82% off 0.6%, the Nasdaq COMP, +0.79% down 0.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.79% shedding 0.4%.

TOKYO (AP) — Asian stocks slipped Monday, as investor worries continued about global trade tensions and prospects for economic growth.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 1.2 percent to 22,426.32, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped nearly 1.1 percent in early trading to 5,832.00. South Korea's Kospi inched down 0.2 percent to 2,156.56. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell nearly 1.0 percent to 25,553.41, while the Shanghai Composite edged down 0.4 percent to 2,597.15.

WALL STREET: The S&P 500 index rose 38.76 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,767.13 to end a six-day losing streak last week. The benchmark index tumbled 4.1 percent during the week, and it's down 5.6 percent since from its latest record high, set Sept. 20. The Nasdaq composite jumped 167.83 points, or 2.3 percent, to 7,496.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished with a gain of 287.16 points, or 1.1 percent, at 25,339.99.

TRADE WORRIES: Investors are growing worried that U.S.-China trade tensions are impairing global economic growth. The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global economic growth last week because of trade tensions and increased interest rates.

THE QUOTE: ""The repercussions of trade tensions that had plagued global equity markets persist,"" said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG in Singapore.

CHINA MEETING: News that Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump may meet have set off some hope that tensions in the trade war between the world's two largest economies might ease. But worries about the increased tariffs the two sides have imposed on each other's goods, a move that tends to dampen growth, are contributing to volatility in financial markets.

ENERGY: U.S. benchmark crude gained 79 cents to $72.13. It added 0.5 percent to $71.34 a barrel in New York Friday. Brent crude, the international standard, added 98 cents to $81.41.

CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 112.14 yen from 112.33 yen late Friday. The euro fell to $1.1553 from $1.1602.
