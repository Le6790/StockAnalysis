"Dow hits record earlier in day, but stocks close little changed as rising rates spook investors","Stocks were mixed on Wednesday, with investors grappling with the positive and negative effects from rising interest rates after the release of strong U.S. economic data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 54 points, after hitting an all-time intraday high earlier in trading of 26,951.81 points. The S&P 500 was closed about unchanged, as losses in consumer and utility stocks outweighed gains in the financial sector. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 percent, with Apple rising 1.2 percent.

Investors sold stocks sensitive to rising rates, including utilities and consumer product companies with large dividends like Procter & Gamble. Shares of banks, which tend to make more money in periods of rising rates, gained with J.P. Morgan Chase adding almost 1 percent on the day.

""Financials are trying to bounce,"" said Mark Newton, managing member at Newton Advisors. ""This group has been under relentless pressure over the last couple weeks, so it's tough to make too much of today's move, but is helping markets to rally a bit more.""

Citigroup also rose about 1 percent, while Bank of America gained 1.4 percent. Regional banks were the biggest gainers in the financial space as the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbed 2.4 percent.

The benchmark 10-year note yield traded near 3.14 percent, hitting its highest level since 2011. The 30-year bond yield, meanwhile, reached its highest level since October 2014. Rates were boosted by the release of stronger-than-expected economic data.

Private payrolls increased by 230,000 in September — the most since February — according to a report from ADP and Moody's Analytics. Economists polled by Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters) expected a gain of 185,000. The report is often seen as a preview to the government's nonfarm payrolls report, which is set for release Friday morning.

""Investors were looking for a rebound from last month's muted results, and they got it,"" said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E-Trade. ""Economic reports, market movement, and even the Fed are all telling us one thing: The economy is in a solid place right now."""
A disconnect between the Dow and the broader market could spell trouble for stocks,"The juggernaut that is the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record for the 15th time this year on Wednesday even as overall market breadth suffered, signaling a potential rough patch for U.S. stocks, according to one well-respected technical analyst.

Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital Research, tweeted out the following chart to show all the times the Dow bucked the prevailing market trend to end at a 52-week high over the past 25 years. The most recent incidence was on Tuesday when the Dow rose to its 14th record finish of the year while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq remain stuck in red.

The Dow DJIA, -0.11% has defied the crowd in this manner 31 times since 1993, with several occurrences clustered in 1999.

This disconnect between the benchmark and market breadth tends to happen when the major indexes are driven by a few good stocks. It’s also worth noting that breadth is often influenced by small-caps and interest-rate sensitive shares, Goepfert said.

The breadth problem is not just limited to the Dow. Strategists at Bespoke Investment Group on Tuesday pointed out that even though the S&P 500 SPX, -0.22% rose in September, the average stock in the large-cap index slipped 0.06%, a result of larger stocks outperforming smaller issues.

In fact, the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500 rose an average of 1.18% last month, while the next 100 largest stocks also posted decent gains. In comparison, the smallest stocks either fell or were relatively flat.

Bespoke Investment Group

Case in point, Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.77% Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.25% Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.84% Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.19% GOOGL, +0.26% and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, +0.09% BRK.A, +0.46% the top 5 stocks by market capitalization, all posted double digit growth this year with Amazon skyrocketing 68%.

At the other end of the spectrum, Stericycle Inc. SRCL, +1.30% Quanta Services Inc. PWR, -0.95% Mattel Inc., MAT, +1.03% H&R Block Inc. HRB, -0.18% and Brighthouse Financial Inc. BHF, -1.04% have all posted losses in 2018.

Further illustrating the divergence, the S&P 500 is up 0.8% while the small-cap Russell 2000 RUT, -0.33% declined 4% over the past month.

And the significance of these contradictory moves is that they are usually followed by market corrections, according to Goepfert.

“While the major indexes continued higher for a while in 1999, it was the last gasp before a bear market,” he said. “In 2007, a bear market followed almost immediately.”

The technical analyst played down the possibility of a bear market this time but predicted that returns are likely to be muted in the coming months.

“When we’ve seen these kinds of ‘split’ breadth conditions in the past, the risk/reward in stocks was unfavorable over the next 2-12 months,” Goepfert said.

Aston Martin IPO; Relief in Italy; Tesco slides,"1. Aston Martin IPO: Aston Martin is joining the ranks of listed automakers with an IPO that values the British company at more than $5 billion.

The favorite carmaker of fictional British secret service agent James Bond has priced its shares at £19.00 ($24.70), giving it a valuation of £4.3 billion ($5.6 billion).

The final share price is 16% below the top of the range that Aston Martin had targeted, reflecting investor doubts about whether the carmaker should be valued in the same league as Italian rival Ferrari.

In going public, the British company is also asking investors to overcome fears about US threats to tax foreign autos and the potential for Britain's planned exit from the European Union to disrupt supply chains and markets.

Shares dropped as much as 6.6% in early London trading on Wednesday.

2. Italian relief: Italian bonds have recovered some ground after Italian media reported that the country's government is close to agreeing a budget with smaller deficits than feared.

The euro strengthened 0.3% against the US dollar and the main stock market in Milan gained over 1%.

Italian bonds have suffered in recent months as the populist government appeared ready to clash with the European Commission over plans to increase public borrowing.

Still, that doesn't mean investors can rest easy. Analysts at Capital Economics warn that a prolonged period of higher bond yields still poses a risk to the country's banks.

""In that case, banks would probably have more trouble funding themselves in wholesale markets,"" the analysts wrote Wednesday. ""And the current government seems much less likely to step in and help struggling lenders than previous administrations.""

A report on crude inventories is set to be released 10:30 a.m. ET.

Shares in Tesco (TSCDF) dropped 5% in London after the UK supermarket chain reported earnings that disappointed investors. The mega retailer launched a new discount chain last month, called Jack, that could help it fend off competition from German discounters.

Turkish inflation reached 24.5% in September, according to new data. The lira slipped 1% against the dollar.

The Dow just closed at a record high — here's how investors are playing the rally,"The Dow hit a new high today—here's how four experts are investing now 3:44 PM ET Wed, 3 Oct 2018 | 02:29

The Dow hit another record high Wednesday, closing its fifth straight session in the green – the index's longest winning streak since mid-July. Here's what four experts had to say about the record run:

""You need to play the market the right way and I think the right way, right now is to get a little bit more defensive. Because these defensive groups, especially the health-care stocks, which are a little overbought near term, but I think still have a lot further to run for a number of different reasons. ... These groups are holding up and are actually slightly outperforming the market, so if you get a little bit more defensive right now, you limit your downside if the market rolls over,"" Matt Maley of Miller Tabak explained.

""Semis have been on an absolute tear for years. There have been, you know, supply shortages not just at Intel but across the board, here. And a lot of consumers of chips have built a lot of inventory, particularly as lead times for these products have stretched and as these shortages have grown. So there is some risk for, perhaps, at least two quarters of this inventory work-down across the board. So some of the broad-based guys, I think, are a little bit more at risk right now,"" said Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna Financial.

""The United States economy is really rolling. It's probably going to continue for some time. And generally, when the U.S. economy is rolling, the world economy comes right behind it. So to sort of jump off the track right now, is sort of missing the bigger picture. I think people need to be more bullish, not less, because as the global leader, both in consumption, manufacturing and everything you can think of, when we rise, everyone else should come along. But it hasn't quite been that way. And I expect that to happen. And so we hear all these crosscurrents. I believe that people should get bullish going into the fourth quarter, not more defensive. I think that's the wrong strategy,"" said Jamie Cox of Harris Financial Group.

""I bought Blackstone yesterday afternoon. I want some exposure, I wanted to take an opportunity in the financials. There is that search for yield out there so that's why I added,"" said Joe Terranova of Virtus Investment Partners.

Bottom line: As the markets continue to rally, investors are being selective when it comes to what to buy now."

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25.32% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through November 5, 2018. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.
